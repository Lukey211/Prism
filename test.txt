Regionally king salmon retention is currently closed for nonresidents in all waters in the Petersburg/Wrangell Management Area except for the Wrangell Narrows portion of the Terminal Harvest Area (closes August 15th) and City Creek (closes July 14th). In order to not exceed the 2025 sport allocation of king salmon this closure is necessary.

The closure does not impact resident anglers. Starting July 15th, the remaining saltwater portion of the Petersburg/Wrangell area will open to resident anglers for king salmon retention with a bag and possession limit of one over 28 inches.Traditionally king salmon catches slow down over the next few weeks but they may still be caught.

There are separate regulations for the Blind Slough/Wrangell Narrows Terminal Harvest Area, City Creek, and the remainder of the region. Please see the Advisory Announcement onour websitefor maps and more specific information about each of these locations. Remember that a king salmon stamp is required whenever fishing for king salmon (including catch and release).

Sockeye salmon are in the saltwater now and entering some local streams. Fishing for them may be slow as they are not aggressive feeders and as such catch rates should be expectedly low. Anglers are reminded that snagging is not allowed in any area freshwaters where sockeye salmon are found.

Pink and Coho salmon should begin to show. Area coho fishing in marine waters traditionally gets going around the third week in July but there have been some early catches up north so we may see them sooner.

King salmon fishing has been good with anglers reporting in many areas around Sitka – including the typical locations (Biorka, Vitskari, and off Kruzoff). Kings are also returning to the Medvejie Hatchery and Silver Bay. Currently, there are no special regulations for kings returning to Medvejie or Silver Bay (regional regulations apply). There is a small area near the barrier net behind the net pens at Medvejie that is now closed to fishing in order to allow hatchery staff access to broodstock. Signs are posted. Resident Anglers are allowed one king daily with no annual limit. The nonresident king fishery isclosedas of July 7th.

For other salmon: Coho are starting to show up offshore and there have been reports of them being large for this early. Chum have also recently shown in Sitka Sound in force. Sockeye salmon are starting off strong. As of 7/6, over 39,900 have passed through the Redoubt Weir. It’s still early for Pink Salmon.

Summer is in full swing on Prince of Wales Island with the arrival of sockeye salmon in some freshwater drainages. Marine fishing for king salmon is currently fair in marine waters; while halibut, rockfish, lingcod and shellfish fishing has been good in marine waters around Prince of Wales.

There are a few sockeye salmon in the Situk River. The weir has passed about 100 sockeye upstream so far. There are only a few small schools holding downstream of the weir to the mouth. Numbers should continue to build throught the coming weeks.

Dolly fishing is excellent right now on the Situk. Dollies are spread throughout the drainage and are feeding on salmon fry and smolt exiting the system.

Sportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters. Reports from marine anglers have indicated slow fishing for kings in Yakutat Bay. Fishing is really spotty and there seems to be a lack of bait fish inside the islands. Water temps are on the cold side of average, which may explain why there is a lack of bait and subsequently a lack of king salmon. Based on reports, fishing is more successful along the outer coast waters than inside the bay. Most anglers troll spoons or herring behind a flasher.
