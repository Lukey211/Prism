This could be due to an earlier than normal season or simply a sign of a strong season that spans a larger timeframe. Currently the creeks are low and we could use some rain. Still, while the water is cold and there’s sun in the forecast I encourage you to get outside and head to your favorite creek. As the water warms slightly you might expect the fishing to get even better. We are entering the best three weeks starting now.\nDolly Varden and Trout\nDolly Varden and trout will become more aggressive chasing your bait as the ice comes off the lakes and the water temperatures start to rise. Dolly Varden and trout are found in many places in the streams and are likely to bite while stripping line or running a jig through a hole with a spinning rod. Other observations include emerging juvenile salmon, which Dolly Varden will be feeding upon.\nKing Salmon\nThe vast majority of marine waters in the Petersburg/Wrangell area are currently closed to king salmon retention. Opportunity to harvest king salmon will be available in areas where Alaska hatchery produced king salmon will be returning beginning June 1, 2024. Advisory Announcements for individual hatcheries are available on our website. Remember that a king salmon stamp is required whenever fishing for king salmon (including catch and release).\nHalibut\nHalibut can be targeted this time of year and anglers have reported some recent success. The sport fishery is open February 1 – December 31, 2024. Reminder: Filleting halibut: No person shall possess on board a vessel, including charter vessels and pleasure craft used for fishing, halibut that have been filleted, mutilated, or otherwise disfigured in any manner, except that each halibut may be cut into no more than 2 ventral pieces, 2 dorsal pieces, and 2 cheek pieces, with enough skin on each piece to identify whether the piece is from the light side or the dark side of the fish.\nLingcod\nSport fishing for lingcod is currently closed in all Southeast Alaska waters but will open on May 16. Nonresident bag and possession limits have changed since last year. Limits: 1 per day, 1 in possession; 30-35 inches or 55 inches and longer. There is an annual limit of 2 fish, 1 of which is 30-35 inches in length, and 1 that is 55 inches or greater in length, harvest record is required. Alaskan Resident bag and possession remain – 1 daily, 2 in possession, no size limit.\nRockfish\nRockfish regulations have remained in place since the last fishing season. Pelagic rockfish regulations remain the same with a daily bag limit of 5 and possession limit of 10 in the Petersburg, Wrangell, and Kake area. Slope and demersal shelf rockfish species both have a daily bag limit of one fish and possession limit of 2 for Alaska residents. Demersal shelf rockfish are closed to retention for nonresidents anglers and yelloweye are closed to retention for all anglers. A helpful species identification guide has been published on the ADFG website. Anglers are reminded that a rockfish release device is now required to be used whenever releasing rockfish and a rockfish release device must be onboard your vessel whenever sport fishing in marine waters."

Steelhead are now dispersed throughout the systems instead of being held up in only the deep holes. The month of May can on occasion offer that beautiful balance of finding the remaining steelhead while fishing in in warmer weather than the colder month of April.\nDolly Varden and Trout\nDolly Varden and trout will are now abundant throughout the creeks. With lighter tackle, the spring offers a good time to seek these fish without having to deal with pink salmon in the streams.

Since these are hatchery produced king salmon, not wild stock, opportunity exist for both resident and nonresident anglers to harvest bag limits of 2 kings 28 inches or greater in length and 2 kings under 28 inches in the specific area of the saltwater portion of the THA. For a nonresident, this does not apply to your annual king salmon limit. The freshwater portion of the THA, Blind Slough, is closed June 1st through July 31st this summer. The reason behind the closure is a small amount of forecasted adult returns to the THA and following the management plan that protects the freshwater kings first as they are most vulnerable to stress in the final stretch leading back to the hatchery.\nAnita Bay opened near Wrangell on June 1st. Resident anglers are allowed a bag limit of 2 king salmon 28 inches or greater in length and nonresident anglers are allowed a bag limit of 1 king salmon 28 inches or greater in length.

Reports are that there are plenty of trout and Dolly Varden to be caught in the streams. Remember to check the bag and size limits of trout in our Sport Fishing Regulations Summary as they do change depending on which stream you are fishing.\nLingcod\nLimits: 1 per day, 1 in possession; 30-35 inches or 55 inches and longer. There is an annual limit of 2 fish, 1 of which is 30-35 inches in length, and 1 that is 55 inches or greater in length, harvest record is required.

One exception close to Petersburg is the Wrangell Narrows/Blind Slough Terminal Harvest Area (THA) which opened on May 15th. King salmon regulations have changed since last year. From May 15 – August 15 fishing is closed to all anglers upstream of a marker at Blind River Rapids to a marker above Crystal Creek. From Blind River Rapids downstream to saltwater, fishing is open to residents only. The saltwater portion of the THA is open to all anglers. The daily king salmon bag/possession limit within the THA is 1 fish any size and the nonresident annual limit is 2 fish any size. Advisory Announcements are available on our website. Remember that a king salmon stamp is required whenever fishing for king salmon (including catch and release).\nHalibut\nThe sport fishery is open February 1 – December 31, 2025. Reminder: Filleting halibut: No person shall possess on board a vessel, including charter vessels and pleasure craft used for fishing, halibut that have been filleted, mutilated, or otherwise disfigured in any manner, except that each halibut may be cut into no more than 2 ventral pieces, 2 dorsal pieces, and 2 cheek pieces, with enough skin on each piece to identify whether the piece is from the light side or the dark side of the fish.\nLingcod\nSport fishing for lingcod is currently closed in all Southeast Alaska waters but will open on May 16, 2025. Residents are allowed a daily bag limit of 1; 2 in possession. Nonresidents are allowed a daily bag limit of 1; 1 in possession; 30-35 inches or 55 inches and longer. There is an annual limit of 2 fish, 1 of which is 30-35 inches in length, and 1 that is 55 inches or greater in length. A harvest record is required. The Northern Southeast Area will be closed to nonresidents for lingcod fishing from June 15 - August 15, 2025.\nRockfish\nRockfish regulations have changed since the last fishing season. The retention of demersal shelf rockfish, including yelloweye, is open for residents of Alaska with a daily bag limit of 1; 2 in possession. Demersal shelf rockfish, including yelloweye, will be open for nonresidents from July 1 through August 25 with an annual limit of 1 fish. Slope Rockfish are open to resident and nonresidents with a daily bag limit of 1; 1 in possession. Pelagic Rockfish are open to resident and nonresidents with a daily bag limit of 3; 6 in possession. A helpful species identification guide has been published on the ADFG website. Anglers are reminded that a rockfish release device is now required to be used whenever releasing rockfish and a rockfish release device must be onboard your vessel whenever sport fishing in marine waters.\nCreel Samplers\nStarting May 15th, Alaska Department of Fish and Game creel samplers will be on the public docks approaching anglers to ask about their catch. The biological samples they collect are used to help manage and sustain a healthy stock required for recreational angling. Please be courteous and provide them the few minutes needed to gather this important information."

The majority of marine waters in the Petersburg/Wrangell area are open to king salmon retention by June 15th. The exception to that are waters adjacent to the Stikine River which will not open until July 15th. King salmon regulations have changed since last year. We have a separate set of regulations for the Blind Slough/Wrangell Narrows Terminal Harvest Area, Anita Bay, Gunnuk Creek, City Creek and the remainder of the region. Please see the Advisory Announcement on our website for maps and more specific information about each of these locations. Remember that a king salmon stamp is required whenever fishing for king salmon (including catch and release).\nHalibut\nHalibut are a hard fighting and delicious species to target right now. If looking for halibut locations, target high points under the water that come up to as shallow 80-100 feet. Large halibut can be at 300 feet or greater. Halibut catch rates should increase as they come into shallow waters over the summer. Traditional fishing areas such as The Eye Opener in Sumner Strait, Level Island, or north of Petersburg in Frederick Sound hold the most promise. Anglers can fish the slack tides with heavy duty gear using either whole or cut herring for bait\nThe Halibut sport fishery is open February 1 – December 31, 2025. Reminder: Filleting halibut: No person shall possess on board a vessel, including charter vessels and pleasure craft used for fishing, halibut that have been filleted, mutilated, or otherwise disfigured in any manner, except that each halibut may be cut into no more than 2 ventral pieces, 2 dorsal pieces, and 2 cheek pieces, with enough skin on each piece to identify whether the piece is from the light side or the dark side of the fish.\nLingcod\nResidents are allowed a daily bag limit of 1; 2 in possession.

Anglers have been successfully targeting halibut in recent weeks. As the summer progresses you might try fishing offshore of a salmon stream outlet as halibut often eat the fish flushed from the stream after spawning. Anglers can fish the slack tides with heavy duty gear using either whole or cut herring for bait\nThe Halibut sport fishery is open February 1 – December 31, 2025. Reminder: Filleting halibut: No person shall possess on board a vessel, including charter vessels and pleasure craft used for fishing, halibut that have been filleted, mutilated, or otherwise disfigured in any manner, except that each halibut may be cut into no more than 2 ventral pieces, 2 dorsal pieces, and 2 cheek pieces, with enough skin on each piece to identify whether the piece is from the light side or the dark side of the fish.\nLingcod\nResidents are allowed a daily bag limit of 1; 2 in possession.

In order to not exceed the 2025 sport allocation of king salmon this closure is necessary.\nThe closure does not impact resident anglers. Starting July 15th, the remaining saltwater portion of the Petersburg/Wrangell area will open to resident anglers for king salmon retention with a bag and possession limit of one over 28 inches.Traditionally king salmon catches slow down over the next few weeks but they may still be caught.\nThere are separate regulations for the Blind Slough/Wrangell Narrows Terminal Harvest Area, City Creek, and the remainder of the region. Please see the Advisory Announcement on our website for maps and more specific information about each of these locations. Remember that a king salmon stamp is required whenever fishing for king salmon (including catch and release).\nSockeye salmon are in the saltwater now and entering some local streams. Fishing for them may be slow as they are not aggressive feeders and as such catch rates should be expectedly low. Anglers are reminded that snagging is not allowed in any area freshwaters where sockeye salmon are found.\nPink and Coho salmon should begin to show. Area coho fishing in marine waters traditionally gets going around the third week in July but there have been some early catches up north so we may see them sooner.\nHalibut\nHalibut catch rates tend to remain consistent in July and this is a good species to target this time of year. If looking for halibut locations, target high points under the water that come up to as shallow 100 feet. Another option might be offshore of a creek that has salmon spawning. Halibut catch rates should increase as they come into shallow waters over the summer. Traditional fishing areas such as The Eye Opener in Sumner Strait or north of town in Frederick Sound hold the most promise. Large halibut tend to be at 300 feet or greater, try to fish the slack tides with heavy duty gear and use whole herring for bait. If you are in Petersburg fishing from a small skiff and need to stay close to town, fish just south of the red buoy just outside of Wrangell Narrows in 300 to 400 feet of water.\nThe Halibut sport fishery is open February 1 – December 31, 2025. Reminder: Filleting halibut: No person shall possess on board a vessel, including charter vessels and pleasure craft used for fishing, halibut that have been filleted, mutilated, or otherwise disfigured in any manner, except that each halibut may be cut into no more than 2 ventral pieces, 2 dorsal pieces, and 2 cheek pieces, with enough skin on each piece to identify whether the piece is from the light side or the dark side of the fish.\nLingcod\nResidents are allowed a daily bag limit of 1; 2 in possession.

Charter operators and business owners, register online or in person for your 2024 elogbook.\nSalmon\nThe warm weather has brought lots of boats out of hibernation for the summer. Some anglers have reported good luck with kings. The creel season just started this week, so there isn’t yet any available catch-per-effort data, however anecdotally, many anglers have had success for kings particularly at Vitskari Rocks. Like the last couple of years, there are several reports of small kings being caught. Fishing for kings should get better through the next couple of months. Other salmon will move inshore later in the season as the weather warms.\nSteelhead\nSteelhead season is here and the peak run timing for many systems around the Sitka Area is the first and second week of May. Initial surveys of steelhead streams around the region have shown typical numbers of fish. The water is a bit warmer than usual which may shift run timing just a few days earlier. \nDolly Varden\nFishing for Dollies can also be good this time of year. Often schools of dollies are attracted to out-migrating salmon fry (this peaks in the next few weeks). Look for them in saltwater near the mouths of creeks and sometimes even up in the streams a ways. Smolt or fry patterns work well for them. All of the streams in the Sitka Area have at least a small population of Dolly Varden.\nHalibut\nFishing for halibut is open. Fishing for halibut is good and stays relatively consistent through the summer. These fish will begin to show up in greater number as weather warms and other fisheries move more inshore.\nLingcod\nFor all anglers, the fishing season opens May 16. The resident season will run through the end of November. There will be a midseason closure for nonresident anglers From June 15th through the end of July. Fishing will again reopen August 1st and run through November as well.\nDemersal Shelf Rockfish (DSR)\nIn 2022, Demersal Shelf Rockfish (DSR) was opened to provide opportunity for residents. Resident anglers are allowed one DSR rockfish daily, two in possession, EXCLUDING YELLOWEYE. DSR are a subset of nonpelagic rockfish including: Yelloweye, Quillback, China, Tiger, Rosethorn, Copper, and Canary.\nSlope Rockfish\nAll anglers are allowed one daily, two in possession. The most common slope rockfish include: Redbanded, Rougheye, Silvergray, Shortraker, and Vermilion.\nPelagic Rockfish\nFishing for rockfish is good year-round. The most commonly caught pelagic rockfish in the Sitka Area are the Black and Yellowtail, although Duskys aren’t uncommon. Try fishing around underwater structure near kelp beds with a dart or jig. These rockfish make for excellent table fare all the time and in the winter when salmon are harder to come by they seem especially good,\nAnglers are allowed 5 daily, 10 in possession, with the exception of CSEO (Sitka Area), where residents are allowed four a day, eight in possession, and nonresidents are allowed two daily, four in possession. See the Sitka Area Special Exceptions for a map of CSEO on page 22 of the Southeast Regulation Summary.\nThe department has developed a guide to assist anglers in identifying species groupings.

Sport fishing has reopened at Medvejie hatchery. Coho are in and are expected to increase throughout August. In late August/September they will begin to enter their natal freshwater streams where numbers will increase into October. Pink and chum salmon are in with good numbers, already beginning to enter their freshwater stages.\nHalibut\nFishing for halibut is open. Fishing for halibut is good and stays relatively consistent through the summer. These fish will begin to show up in greater numbers as weather warms and other fisheries move more inshore. See NOAA for sport fishing regulations.\nLingcod\nFor all anglers, the fishing season opened May 16. The resident season will run through the end of November. There was a midseason closure for nonresident anglers From June 15th through the end of July. Fishing for nonresidents has reopened as of August 1st and will run through November.\nDemersal Shelf Rockfish (DSR)\nIn 2022, Demersal Shelf Rockfish (DSR) was opened to provide opportunity for residents. Resident anglers are allowed one DSR rockfish daily, two in possession, EXCLUDING YELLOWEYE. DSR are a subset of nonpelagic rockfish including: Yelloweye, Quillback, China, Tiger, Rosethorn, Copper, and Canary.\nSlope Rockfish\nAll anglers are allowed one daily, two in possession. The most common slope rockfish include: Redbanded, Rougheye, Silvergray, Shortraker, and Vermilion.\nPelagic Rockfish\nFishing for rockfish is good year-round. The most commonly caught pelagic rockfish in the Sitka Area are the Black and Yellowtail, although Duskys aren’t uncommon. Try fishing around underwater structures near kelp beds with a dart or jig. These rockfish make for excellent table fare.\nAnglers are allowed 5 daily, 10 in possession, with the exception of CSEO (Sitka Area), where residents are allowed four a day, eight in possession, and nonresidents are allowed two daily, four in possession.

Peak timing for steelhead in the Sitka Area is early/mid-May but fish can be found in some streams until early June. Fishing has been reported as good. Rainbows, cutthroat, and Dolly Varden have hit the streams as well. When the water warms up in the spring, resident trout often move from the lakes into the outlet streams. During steelhead surveys, good numbers of rainbows, cutthroat, and dollies have been observed in all the streams surveyed.\nSalmon\nKing salmon fishing is open and the season is beginning. Catches have been reported in several locations around Sitka, with some anglers reports of large fish and good fishing. The weather has been tough for much of the last month, but if you can get out, the typical hot spots are producing some…Vitskari Rocks, Cape Edgcumbe, and Biorka Island.

Lets talk about the only game in town, steelhead. What are the highlights entering the 2024 steelhead season? Well, the first noiticable thing is the lack of snow pack. In recent seasons prior, there is typically a healthy layer of snow across the river banks and along the trails making it difficult getting around by foot. That is definitely not the case this year. Staff was able to easily access fishing locations above the 9-mile bridge this past weekend. So walking conditions are excellent on land in that regard. However, its never always that easy. A large number of trees have fallen during the winter due to high winds and have blocked some of the trails along the river so anglers will need to do some bush-whacking. And wading the river above 9-mile is still challenging due to more trees falling across the river. More fishing holes it seems have either been blocked by trees or have filled in due to high flows pushing gravel into them. Its challenging to find good fishing locations up high is the take home.\nWater conditions on the Situk are excellent right now for walking and wading. The current water level on the Situk River is 276 cfs/in, which is close to prime for fishing and is excellent for wading. Boat travel is also good at these levels. Water temperatures are decent as well, with temps similar to those seen the previous two years. Adding all the environmental cues together one could surmise this sets up for slightly earlier run-timing or at least average run-timing.\nSo with regards to run-timing, what are we seeing in fish numbers so far? Well, there are some fish that have moved downstream from the lake earlier than we've seen in the previous few years. Staff observed fish spread throughout the upper section of the Situk above 9-mile Bridge. Reports have also been confirmed that there are some lake fish below 9-mile Bridge earlier than the previous few years. The Lower Situk river has been sparse in terms of reports and angling effort, so we don't have much information from down low. With water conditions and terrestrial conditions how they are currently and with the chilly weather that has persisited in the last week or more, I would guess run-timing to be average to maybe a slightly more earlier run. That means fresh spring run fish should start entering in good numbers down low around the 3rd week of April and end around the middle of May.\nSaltwaters\nKing Salmon\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters. The staff has received no reports of sport fishing out in Yakutat Bay. Most anglers troll spoons or herring behind a flasher.\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing is slow.\nLingcod\nLingcod fishing is closed until May 16th.\nRockfish\nFishing for rockfish should be excellent in the Yakutat area.\nFor further information, please get in touch with the Yakutat Area Sport Fish management biologist Jason Pawluk at (907) 784-3222."

But pickets were put back in on Wednesday and counting has resumed. As expected, the high waters from the rains pushed fish upstream and basically cleared out the lower and middle river of fish. So as a result of that fishing will be difficult over the next week or so. Fishing should be better in the lower section of river as fish start to refill that section as they work their way upstream. Expect to see other species soon such as pink salmon and a few coho mixed in with the sockeye. So far over 40,000 sockeye have passed the weir. Water levels are a little high still but should be fishable for sockeye over the next week or more. Boaters should have better access to the fish which may be spread out more.\nThe daily bag and possession limits of sockeye salmon on the Situk River were liberalized to six fish a day and twelve fish in possession, effective Thursday, July 11th.\nSituk River Sockeye Salmon Bag Limit Increase Announcement\nSaltwaters\nKing Salmon\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters.

Fishing continues to be slow and spotty inside the islands, with Monti Bay and Ocean Cape producing better catch rates. Most anglers troll spoons or herring behind a flasher.\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing has slowed some with more smaller fish being caught. Anglers are having a harder time finding sizable fish, and based on angler reports, dogfish have flooded into the area making fishing extremely difficult. Advice for avoiding dogfish include ceasing the use of chumbags, moving frequently, and taking breaks between soaking bait to try and clear them out. For halibut, try sitting on anchor while using herring, salmon carcasses, or squid/octopus for bait, or try drifting with jigs baited with herring or unbaited.

Anglers have been reporting good catches this past week, with the best success in the lower half of the river. The weather over the next few days is expected to raise the river level pretty good so fishing could be difficult from shore. Try using spinners or jigs with single hooks early in the morning or during the evening hours.\nPink salmon are winding down on the Situk River. The fish are well past being fresh but can still provide some entertainment. Try using anything with a single barbed hook that has color or dances around.\nSaltwaters\nKing Salmon\nSportfishing for king salmon is CLOSED in Yakutat area marine waters. Fishing was closed effective Monday, August 26th. No king salmon may be retained and any king salmon caught must be released immediately.\nCoho Salmon\nCoho fishing continues to be good with limits being caught out near Ocean Cape, Point Munoz, and outside of Kahntaak Island. Fishing should be good inside the islands of Yakutat Bay for the next few weeks also as fish move along the shorelines. There are alot of storms forecasted this week which will make it difficult to get out to fish so be careful. Most anglers troll spoons or herring behind a flasher, or try mooching herring or jigging small dart jigs.\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing continues to be difficult with smaller fish being caught and more incliment weather making getting out to the grounds more difficult. Fishing success should start to decline with fish thinning out over the entire Yakutat Bay and along the coastline. For halibut, try sitting on anchor while using herring, salmon carcasses, or squid/octopus for bait, or try drifting with jigs baited with herring or unbaited.\nLingcod\nLingcod fishing is excellent in the Yakutat area. Lingcod are spread out throughout the area but like to hang out near rocky structures or pinnacles. Typically using herring as bait, or using any type of jig will work.\nRockfish\nFishing for black rockfish is excellent in the Yakutat area. The best location to catch them are along the pinnacles and rocky structures found underwater along the entrance to Yakutat Bay. Try using small dart jigs or mooching herring near shallow rocky structures.\n\nCheck out the new gofishak interactive map to discover popular fishing locations and information on species run timing, fishing gear selections, and boat and angler access tips!\nFor further information, please get in touch with the Yakutat Area Sport Fish management biologist Jason Pawluk at (907) 784-3222."

Most saltwater anglers troll spoons or herring behind a flasher, or try mooching herring or jigging small dart jigs. For coho moving along the shore try casting lures such as spinners or spoons when you see fish surface.\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing has been spotty over the last week. Dogfish are still creating problems out front. Fish size picked up some but small fish are still in the mix.

Anglers have observed groups of fish spread out throughout the river. Prior to last weekend, the Situk had been experiencing very low water levels which made fishing difficult. The rain arrived last weekend as expected, but it's turned into one of those \"be careful what you wish for\" scenarios. It's basically been raining/sleeting ever since and both air and water temperatures have dropped making for some pretty chilly conditions. Also of note is the fact that the Situk River water gauging station went out last weekend making it anyones guess what the current water level is. Based on the amount of rain we've had, discharge rates are most likely above 450 cfs which makes it pretty difficult to wade fish and cross the river. Anglers should take caution when fishing by foot. Boat anglers will have the most success in dealing with the higher water levels to a point. The extended forecast calls for more rain so it looks like we could have challenging conditions for awhile.\nSaltwaters\nKing Salmon\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters.

It's basically been raining/sleeting/snowing since April 5th and both air and water temperatures remain very cool. That being said, fishing reports have been decent with some nice fish being caught. The issue at hand currently is water levels are so high that only boat anglers are enjoying the spoils as levels are currently too high for wading anglers. Unfortunately the river gauging station is still not functioning and we are left in the dark as to having some sort of index or measure of where exactly water levels are at currently. One thing is for certain though, the last reading of 477cfs at 730am yesterday combined with over 2.5\" of rain falling in the last 28 hours, produce water levels that are too high for river crossing and should remain that way for the next few days. Anglers should take extreme caution when fishing by foot and not attempt to cross the river until levels drop significantly. Boat anglers will have the most success in dealing with the higher water levels and in turn be able to get to the fish better than shore anglers. The extended forecast calls for less rain so hopefully conditions will imporve for shore anglers by Monday or Tuesday of next week.\nSaltwaters\nKing Salmon\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters.

Water levels in turn have remained high but still fishable. The good news is for now we have a functioning river gauging station. It came online last night and we are currently sitting at 485 cfs, which is bordering on doable wade fishing conditions (450 cfs). It looks like we have some decent weather for the next few days and that will lead to a drop in water levels, so for the immediate future it looks like good conditions all around. Rain is forecast starting Sunday through most of next week so it will be short-lived. Fishing reports continue to be decent with some really nice fish being caught. Fish moved upstream with our recent high water so the majority of fish are in the upper river spawning. Some fresh fish continue to enter the lower river but will most likely be moving upstream at a faster clip with the water levels we have. Run-timing seems to be a little on the early side based on environmental conditions so we may be at the peak or slightly past it. Either way fishing is good right now, the weather not so much. Enjoy these next few days while you can before the next rain events start on Sunday.\nSaltwaters\nKing Salmon\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters. Department staff received their first sport fishing report for saltwater king salmon fishing.

Water levels from this last storm have current water levels sitting at unfishable levels if you are trying to wade fish by foot. We are currently sitting at 629 cfs, which is above doable wade fishing conditions (450 cfs). Rain is forecast to continue today and tomorrow before a small break and then another storm Sunday and Monday. Weather starts to look decent starting on Wednesday of next week with precipitation amounts dropping significantly. Boat anglers will be unaffected by the higher water levels and in fact will probably benefit from it in terms of reaching and not spooking fish. Fishing reports have been spotty lately with anglers hitting fish one day, and then nothing the next. Staff and AWT troopers touched up the upper river spawning closure markers and contacted sport anglers on their way out. There are alot of dark fall run/lake fish that are currently spawning in the upper reaches. The bite is off for the most part up there. Fresh fish however are entering the lower river and provide a good chance for hooking up given spawning fish are off the bite. Numbers of fresh fish appear to be decent but not sure about timing yet. If the cooler weather has any effect, then we could be seeing later run-timing for the spring component which would have them coming in good right about now. We'll see.\nSaltwaters\nKing Salmon\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters. More sport fishing reports for saltwater king salmon fishing have come in over the past week.

Is this what Southeast Alaskans refer to as a \"sucker hole?\" Whatever it is......we'll take it. What a last 33 days we've had here in Yakutat. Since April 5th, 24.49\" of precipitation has fallen in Yakutat, when on average only 9.90\" of rain usually falls. Last week saw water levels rise again with all the rain we had maintaining the difficult wading conditions. Currently the gauge has the Situk at 549 cfs, which is way better than where we've been for awhile. And, there's no rain today so levels are dropping. Forecast looks better than what its been doing here the last month. There are some showers in the near and long-term forecast but no significant rain events until maybe Monday night. Boat anglers have continued to do decent while fishing this last week, but it has been spotty. Shore based anglers have also been getting into a few fish above the bridge with fresh spring entry fish making it up into that neck of the river. Overall, fishing should be winding down here soon, just as water levels are getting back to normal.\nSaltwaters\nKing Salmon\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters.

Water levels are finally normal again. Fish have been making their way out of the Situk for weeks now. Very few fresh fish are entering the river. Anglers should expect fishing to taper off here over the next week or so.\nDolly Varden\nDolly fishing is excellent right now. Large numbers of Dolly Varden are present in the Situk River and other freshwaters in the Yakutat management area. They are feasting on emigrating pink salmon fry, and salmon smolt. Almost any lure or fly can be used to catch them.\nCutthroat Trout\nCutthroat trout fishing is good right now. The best location to target them is Tawah Creek. They are spread throughout the drainage and are similar to Dolly Varden in that you can use a variety of lures or flies to target them.\nSaltwaters\nKing Salmon\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters. Fishing over the last week has improved for saltwater king salmon. Fish are spread out throughout Yakutat Bay, with more fish being caught out front and near the Pinnacles in the middle of Yakutat Bay. Most anglers troll spoons or herring behind a flasher. Please check the department website below for the recent emergency order and advisory announcements regarding 2025 regional king salmon regulations for Southeast Alaska.\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing continues to improve. Weather has been decent lately for getting out front, and anglers have done well when they can. The forecast looks decent for the next few days but sours some starting on Sunday all through next week. Anglers are anchoring up and soaking herring/octopus/salmon heads on circle hooks or using baited jigs as they drift.\nLingcod\nLingcod fishing is open in the Yakutat area. Fishing has been excellent so far. Please check the department website for the recent emergency order and advisory annoucements regarding changes to lingcod regulations in the Yakutat management area.

Water levels are healthy at 329cfs at the time of this writing. Forecast calls for more rain so levels will rise some, but still within fishable conditions. Sockeye have been observed by staff and anglers holding downstream of the weir to the mouth, however the numbers are low at this time. No sockeye have been counted past the weir so far. Expect sockeye abundance to increase around the first week of June.\nDolly Varden\nDolly fishing continues to be excellent. Large numbers of Dolly Varden are present in the Situk River and other freshwaters in the Yakutat management area. They are feasting on emigrating pink salmon fry, and salmon smolt. Almost any lure or fly can be used to catch them.\nCutthroat Trout\nCutthroat trout fishing is good right now. The best location to target them is Tawah Creek. They are spread throughout the drainage and are similar to Dolly Varden in that you can use a variety of lures or flies to target them.\nSaltwaters\nKing Salmon\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters. Fishing over the last week was spotty for saltwater king salmon. Some good catches were observed in Johnstone Pass and Monti Bay, with alot of misses at other locations. Charters reported decent catches out front along the pinnacles. Fishing seems to be picking up. Most anglers troll spoons or herring behind a flasher. Please check the department website below for the recent emergency order and advisory announcements regarding 2025 regional king salmon regulations for Southeast Alaska.\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing was good this last week with large halibut continuing to be brought in. Weather has been marginal for getting out front. The forecast looks decent for the weekend. Anglers are anchoring up and soaking herring/octopus/salmon heads on circle hooks or using baited jigs as they drift.\nLingcod\nLingcod fishing is open in the Yakutat area.

Cruel Summer. Weather continues to be a factor, or deterrant, however you want to look at it. We continue to get rain storm after rain storm here in Yakutat this spring/summer and its made sport fishing in freshwaters pretty difficult. Situk water level is currently between storms at 329cfs at the time of this writing. The forecast calls for another major storm to roll through starting tomorrow and last through Sunday. Water levels will undoubtedly rise above 600 cfs making shore fishing almost impossible down low where the sockeye are holding. Things look to improve starting next week when weather seems to calm down a bit for possibly an extended period of time. We finally saw a push of sockeye go through the weir last night when over 3,800 fish passed. More fish are holding downstream but will most likely move up with this next storm. Fishing for sockeye on the Situk should be good for the next few weeks.\nDolly Varden\nDolly fishing continues to be excellent. Large numbers of Dolly Varden are present in the Situk River and other freshwaters in the Yakutat management area. They are feasting on emigrating pink salmon fry, and salmon smolt.

Trollers did alright at the Pinnacles as well. Most anglers troll spoons or herring behind a flasher. Please check the department website below for the recent emergency order and advisory announcements regarding 2025 regional king salmon regulations for Southeast Alaska.\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing was slow this last week with the bad weather constantly rolling through. Dogfish are present already making it difficult finding halibut. Smaller fish were brought in this week, with the occassional big fish brought in. The forecast looks dismal for the weekend, however next week looks very good with no storms on the horizon.

The river peaked in discharge late Sunday evening around ~1,700 cfs. Water levels over 600 cfs pretty much make wade fishing impossible, so fishing has been put on hold since Saturday. One of the other casualties of the high water this weekend was the weir, which blew out sometime late Sunday night. As a result there have been no fish counts for almost six days. Prior to the weir washing out, the crew had passed over 5,000 sockeye in two days with more behind it. It was starting to look like another good run. The good news is that water levels are dropping, and knock on wood (hold on, let me do it.....there), the long-term forecast is looking good with a possible shift into the correct weather pattern for this time of year. Currently the water discharge is at ~500 cfs and dropping. Water should continue to drop and fishing conditions should be good for the foreseeable future. The 9-mile Bridge fishing closure goes into effect on Sunday, June 15th.\nDolly Varden\nDolly fishing should be excellent. Large numbers of Dolly Varden are present in the Situk River and other freshwaters in the Yakutat management area. They are feasting on emigrating pink salmon fry, and salmon smolt.

Dogfish are present already making it difficult finding halibut. Smaller fish were brought in this week, with the occassional big fish brought in. The good news is that the marine forecast is setting up really nice for the next week. Folks should take advantage of the upcoming good weather and get out on the salt! Anglers are anchoring up and soaking herring/octopus/salmon heads on circle hooks or using baited jigs as they drift.\nLingcod\nLingcod fishing is open in the Yakutat area.

Water levels are at normal and has made fishing quite good. The weir is back up and running and counts are projecting a good run so far. The long term forecast calls for rain so weather isn't looking too hot, but the rain levels shouldn't be enough to push anglers off the river this time around. Fishing should be good for the next few weeks. The Situk River within 50 yards of both upstream/downstream of the 9-mile Bridge is closed to sport fishing.\nDolly Varden\nDolly fishing should be excellent. Large numbers of Dolly Varden are present in the Situk River and other freshwaters in the Yakutat management area. They are feasting on emigrating pink salmon fry, and salmon smolt. Almost any lure or fly can be used to catch them. Try mimicking salmon smolt or fry when choosing a lure.\nCutthroat Trout\nCutthroat trout fishing continues to be excellent right now. The best location to target them is Tawah Creek. The Tawah Creek within 50 yards of both upstream/downstream of the Cannon Beach Road Bridge is closed to sport fishing. They are spread throughout the drainage and are similar to Dolly Varden in that you can use a variety of lures or flies to target them.\nSaltwaters\nKing Salmon\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters. Fishing for kings this last week was pretty slow in most places. The hot spot this last week definetly was Monti Bay in locations like Point Turner, Point Munoz, and Point Carrew. Regular drags inside the islands were pretty devoid of fish this last week. Most anglers troll spoons or herring behind a flasher. Please check the department website below for the recent emergency order and advisory announcements regarding 2025 regional king salmon regulations for Southeast Alaska.\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing was excellent this last week with regards to weather and nice fish being caught. The weather has allowed anglers to get out to wherever they want to this last week, with most anglers going out front of Yakutat Bay. Catches were good early, but slowed some around the area around Buoy #2. Sounds like anglers are moving around to find bigger halibut to such places as Point Mambi and in the back of Yakutat Bay. The forecast looks decent this next week, but there are a few wind events so the seas will be a little lumpier than last week for sure but still doable. Anglers are anchoring up and soaking herring/octopus/salmon heads on circle hooks or using baited jigs as they drift.\nLingcod\nLingcod fishing is open in the Yakutat area. Fishing has been excellent so far. Please check the department website for the recent emergency order and advisory annoucements regarding changes to lingcod regulations in the Yakutat management area.

The long term forecast calls for rain all next week at decent levels, so rising water levels are expected late this weekend. Rising water levels shouldn't prevent fishing, especially boat fishing, but could make wade shore fishing a little more difficult. Fishing should be good for the next few weeks.

Spring Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout fishing in the estuaries is just beginning, steelhead can be caught and released in area streams (other than Peterson Creek, which is closed) and crabbing for Dungeness and Tanner crab is still good.\nAlthough the harvesting of king salmon is currently closed in the immediate waters around Juneau, there are certainly opportunities coming up soon. The hatchery area will open June 1 and the rest of the marine waters will open June 15. When these areas open, Juneau shoreside anglers can cast large spoons or small herring at locations such as False Outer Point (June 1), Tee Harbor (June 15), and the Breadline (June 15) for king salmon. Marine boat anglers looking to go king salmon fishing in the Juneau area should troll using flashers, spoons, or herring rigs in Fritz Cove, Auke Bay or Lena Cove. Here are some recommendations on king salmon tackle and gear set-ups for both shoreside and marine boat anglers. More ambitious marine boat anglers looking to enjoy the nicer weather and harvest a king salmon before June 1 can do so under regionwide regulations by venturing west of Lemesurier Island in Icy Strait. Just be sure to file a float plan with someone before you leave and be prepared to play cards or cribbage in a safe anchorage if you have to wait for the weather to improve.\nSoutheast Regionwide King Salmon Sport Fishing Regulations - (OPEN JUNE 15 in Juneau Area)\nAlaskan resident:\n\nThe resident bag and possession limit is two king salmon, 28 inches or greater in length;\n\nNonresident:\n\nThe nonresident bag and possession limit is one king salmon, 28 inches or greater in length;\nJanuary 1st – June 30th, the nonresident annual harvest limit is three king salmon, 28 inches or greater in length;\nJuly 1st – July 15th, the nonresident annual harvest limit is two king salmon, 28 inches or greater in length; any king salmon harvested from January 1 through June 30 will apply towards the two fish annual harvest limit;\nJuly 16th – December 31st, the nonresident annual harvest limit is one king salmon, 28 inches or greater in length; any king salmon harvested from January 1 through July 15 will apply towards the one fish annual harvest limit;\nImmediately upon landing and retaining a king salmon, a nonresident must enter the species, date, and location on the back of their sport fishing license or on a nontransferable harvest record;\n\nThe Southeast regionwide bag and possession limits above will apply in all areas except as modified below for the inside waters in the vicinity of Juneau:\nMarine waters near Juneau except Seymour Canal and upper Taku Inlet: (The waters of District 9 north of a line from Patterson Pt. to Pt. Ellis, District 10, Sections 11-A, 11-B, 11-C, District 12, Portion of Section 13-C southeast of a line between Nismeni Pt. and a point on the Chichagof Island shoreline at 57° 35.59' N. lat., 135° 22.33' W. long., Sections 14-B and 14-C, and District 15 south of the latitude of Sherman Rock; see map below)\n\nApril 1 through June 14, 2023: No retention of king salmon. All king salmon caught must be released immediately.\n\nIn the waters adjacent to the Taku River:(Taku Inlet north of a line from Point Bishop to Point Greely, see map below)\n\nApril 1 through June 30, 2023: No retention of king salmon. All king salmon caught must be released immediately.\n\nIn the waters adjacent to the King Salmon River: (Section 11-D, Seymour Canal north of 57° 37' N. latitude, see map below)\n\nApril 1 through June 30, 2023: closed to king salmon fishing, all anglers may not target or retain king salmon.\n\n\nJuneau Hatchery Area Sport Fishing Regulations - OPEN JUNE 1\nTake a moment to view the Hatchery King Salmon Regulations map below opening June 1. Please note the closed area in Gastineau Channel. This closure is necessary because the projected return is low and we need as many kings back to the fish ladder as possible to help with future production.\nLena Cove, Auke Bay, and Fritz Cove\nWithin the designated saltwater hatchery sport harvest area consisting of the contiguous waters of Stephens Passage, Auke Bay, Fritz Cove and Gastineau Channel, enclosed on the west by a line running from the tip of Point Louisa to the navigational aid at the northern tip of Portland Island (58 o 21.13’N., 134 o 45.52’W) then along the eastern shore of Portland Island to its most southern point and ending on Douglas Island at the northern tip of Outer Point, and enclosed on the east by a line extending from the Salmon Creek Bridge to a regulatory marker on the Douglas shore and all salt waters of Lena Cove south of a line from Pt. Lena to a regulatory marker on the mainland shore located at 58o 24.20’N. lat.,134o 45.64’W. long.\n\nBag and possession limit of 4 king salmon of any size.\nNon-residents annual limit of king salmon caught in the hatchery sport harvest area do not count toward their annual limit.\n\nMacaulay Hatchery\n(DIPAC) is closed to snagging and king salmon fishing. Snagging is prohibited and king salmon may not be targeted or retained. Any king salmon caught must be released immediately.\nGastineau Channel\nKing salmon may not be targeted or retained and is closed to king salmon fishing. Any king salmon caught must be released immediately from the salmon creek bridge to the ADF&G marker ¼ mile south of Dupont Dock.\n\nOther Spring Fishing Opportunities\nFish Creek and Fish Creek Pond\nAnglers are reminded that the daily bag and possession limit for king salmon in all freshwaters crossed by the Juneau road system including Fish Creek and Fish Creek Pond are 4 fish, any size and any king salmon harvested by non-residents do not count toward their annual limit. Please note that within Fish Creek Pond, from June 1 - August 31, anglers may use bait, may snag, and may use weighted hooks, lures, and treble hooks with a gap greater than ½ inch between the point and shank. However, in Fish Creek itself, anglers may NOT use bait, or snag, or use the aforementioned large treble hooks. The marine waters at the mouth of Fish Creek fall under the Terminal Hatchery Area (THA) regulations, and snagging is allowed in salt waters.\nDolly Varden and cutthroat trout Fishing\nTill the end of May, anadromous Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout will begin to move into saltwater and will congregate at the mouths of local creeks to feed on emigrating salmon fry and smolts. In particular, Dolly Varden will gather at creek mouths along Gastineau Channel such as Salmon Creek and Sheep Creek, while cutthroat trout will group together at the mouths of Cowee Creek, Fish Creek, and Montana Creek. Using small smolt imitation fly patterns or small spinners and spoons is the best way to catch these fish.\nThere will also be some fish that do not leave their \"overwintering\" sites and head for the ocean. Known as \"residents\", these fish stay in their home lake, pond, or stream the entire year. While these fish may move around in the system to take advantage of food or environmental conditions, they will be present for your fishing all year. Windfall Lake and the Dredge Lakes area are the best locations to find resident Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout.\nIn all drainages crossed by the Juneau road system, as well as the saltwater adjacent to the Juneau road system to a line ¼ mile offshore, cutthroat and rainbow trout bag limits (in combination) are 2 daily, 2 in possession with a 14-inch minimum and 22-inch maximum size limit. Dolly Varden limits are 2 daily, 2 in possession, no size limit. Anglers should check the 2023 Southeast Alaska Sportfish Regulation Summary for special regulations specific to the stream or lake they intend to fish.\nSteelhead Trout Fishing\nSteelhead adults will soon begin returning to their natal streams to spawn. On the Juneau road system, Montana Creek and especially Cowee Creek, are the best locations to find steelhead. In Southeast Alaska, most streams that contain steelhead have small annual returns (in the hundreds) and thus can be vulnerable to over-fishing. Retention of steelhead in the Juneau area is prohibited. Any steelhead caught in a drainage crossed by the Juneau road system must be released immediately. Current regionwide regulations elsewhere, away from the road system, prohibit any steelhead under 36\" from being harvested and require that a harvest record be completed in ink immediately upon landing a steelhead that is to be harvested. Keep in mind that all fish should be treated with great care regardless of size to ensure the best chances for survival upon release. Please keep fish in the water while releasing. Our website has more advice on proper catch-and-release methods.\nAnglers should note that all sport fishing in Peterson Creek from the falls to the intertidal waters within a 200-yard radius of the creek mouth at saltwater is CLOSED April 1-June 30 to protect spawning steelhead. The Advisory Announcement can be found here and is provided below.\nSport Fishing Closed in Peterson Creek\nA portion of Peterson Creek, north of Juneau, is closed to sport fishing for all species. Specific restrictions are as follows:\n\nThe waters of Peterson Creek, including Peterson Lagoon, from the intertidal waters within a 200-yard radius of the creek mouth at saltwater to the falls approximately 1.5 miles upstream are CLOSED to sport fishing from April 1 - June 30, 2024, to protect spawning steelhead.\n\nBased on snorkel survey expansions, in years when concurrent weir counts were available, overall production of steelhead in Peterson Creek has declined in recent years. For the last 9 years (2015–2023), snorkel survey index counts conducted each spring have been below the 1997–2014 average of 28 (equivalent to about 116 fish), when steelhead abundance in the creek appeared to be relatively stable. In 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 the snorkel survey counts were 6, 3, 11, 24, 18, and 27 fish, respectively. A conservative approach is necessary to manage the Peterson Creek steelhead stock during this period of very low escapements.\nFor more information, please call the Division of Sport Fish Region 1 office in Douglas at 907-465-4270.\n\nShellfish Harvesting\nExcept for red and blue king crab, other shellfish are currently available to harvest. Personal use red and blue king crab fishing is currently closed (beginning April 1), to protect molting and mating crab, but will reopen July 1.\nKing Crab\nPersonal use king crab fishing is only open to Alaskan residents. A sport fishing license and a Southeast Alaska Regional Personal Use King Crab Permit are required. These are available at the ADF&G online store. Please check for Personal Use Emergency Orders, legal-size and pot configurations, and restrictions online. Section 11-A is currently CLOSED to Alaskan resident PU king crab fishing. Stay tuned for the Juneau area PU announcement later this year using the link above. Harvest must be reported online. Please check the 2024 Southeast Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary booklet pages 33-36 for regulations specific to shellfish.\nDungeness and Tanner Crab\nFor Alaskan residents in the Juneau area, licensed anglers can keep 20 Dungeness males, a 6.5\" minimum width. While taking Dungeness crab, 5 pots or 10 rings per person may be used, with a max of 10 pots or 20 rings per vessel. While taking Tanner crab, no more than 4 pots or 10 rings per vessel may be used. In total, no more than 5 pots per person and 10 pots per vessel may be used for taking shellfish regardless of pot type.\nFor nonresidents in the Juneau area, licensed anglers can keep 3 male Tanner and Dungeness crab (in combination). Tanner males need to be 5.5\" minimum width and Dungeness males need to be 6.5\" minimum width.\nShrimp\nSport and personal use shrimp fisheries in the Juneau and Tenakee area will remain CLOSED until further notice. The closed area consists of all marine waters of Section 11-A north and west of a line extending from a regulatory marker near point Bishop to the Coast Guard marker and light on Point Arden, extending to a line at the latitude of Little Island light, and east of a line from Little Island light to Point Retreat light. And the Tenakee closed area consists of all marine waters in Tenakee Inlet west of the longitude of Corner Point at 135° 06.50' W long. Check the Sport and Personal Use Advisory Announcement,\nOutside the Juneau 11-A and Tenakee Inlet areas, sport and personal use shrimp fishing remains open. Sport and personal use shrimpers who have a valid sport fishing license must also have a free shrimp permit available on the ADF&G online store. Participating anglers must sign their permit in ink to make it valid and have the permit in possession while taking shrimp in Southeast Alaska. Shrimp limits and gear requirements for sport and personal use shrimp fishing cab be found on pages 33-36 of the 2024 Southeast Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary. Reporting of effort and harvest is required and must be submitted to the department even if you did not fish.\nClams\nEvery fall/winter season, the Douglas office gets questions about harvesting clams in the Juneau area. ADF&G does not recommend harvesting clams from any waters in the Juneau area due to the possibility that the clams may contain Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) toxins. Currently, no beaches in the Juneau area are monitored on a regular basis (i.e- \"certified\") for PSP toxins. If you harvest, you do so at your own risk of PSP poisoning. Sporadic sampling has been conducted by the Southeast Alaska Tribal Ocean Research (SEATOR) project, but clams of any species and at any time during the year may still contain toxic levels of PSP. Please navigate to the following Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) web page for more information about PSP.\nInteractive Fishing Location Maps\nNEW!

There seem to be a lot of chum salmon around indicating an early or very strong return on chums to the Juneau area. Unfortunately, the Chinook salmon return to the hatchery has been poor and broodstock goals are not likely to be achieved. The terminal harvest areas of Auke Bay, Fritz Cove, and the Gastineau Channel will be closed to king salmon fishing from June 24 – August 31. Lena Cove will remain open unless otherwise specified in a future advisory announcement. Be sure to check this advisory announcement.\nStill too early for coho, but some Chinook chum, and pink salmon are making their way through the terminal harvest zones where the rest of the marine waters opened Saturday June 15 for king salmon. Marine boat anglers looking to go king salmon fishing in the Juneau area should troll using flashers, spoons, or herring rigs on the backside of Douglas, Point Retreat and Shelter Island. Here are some recommendations on king salmon tackle and gear set-ups for both shoreside and marine boat anglers. Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout can still be caught in estuaries and mouth of creeks.\nHalibut are steadily returning to shallower marine waters as summer comes upon us. There has been some good luck for halibut fishing in the typical hotspots such as the North Shelter-Lincoln Island areas. Remember to check in on your regulations for charter (guided) vs unguided halibut fishing regulations.\nWith nicer weather comes more effort and fishing opportunities. And that certainly shines true with rockfish. Our most common pelagic rockfish to be seen is our beautiful dusky rockfish, especially in waters near South Shelter Island.\nJuneau Hatchery Area Will be CLOSED Starting June 24 \nTake a moment to view the Hatchery King Salmon Regulations map below CLOSING June 24. This closure is necessary to protect broodstock needed for future production. The hatchery area closures and Fish Creek Pond closure will assist in collecting broodstock to help achieve egg-take goals.\nAuke Bay, Fritz Cove, Gastineau Channel \nWithin the designated saltwater hatchery sport harvest area consisting of the contiguous waters of Stephens Passage, Auke Bay, Fritz Cove and Gastineau Channel, enclosed on the west by a line running from the tip of Point Louisa to the navigational aid at the northern tip of Portland Island (58 o 21.13’N., 134 o 45.52’W) then along the eastern shore of Portland Island to its most southern point and ending on Douglas Island at the northern tip of Outer Point, and enclosed on the east by a line located approximately ¼ mile south of the Dupont dock and extending across Gastineau Channel between department markers (see attached map #1).\n\nClosed to king salmon fishing, king salmon may not be targeted or retained.\n\nMacaulay Hatchery\nThe salt waters of Gastineau Channel within a 300-yard radius of the Wayside Park Fishing Dock (Channel Wayside fishing dock – see attached map #1 insert).\n\nClosed to king salmon fishing and snagging for all species.\n\nKing salmon returning to the Douglas Island Pink and Chum, Inc. Macaulay Salmon Hatchery are not expected to meet broodstock goals this year. The return of hatchery produced king salmon to Juneau waters appears to be low based on the number of tag recoveries to date. Therefore, these closures are necessary to protect broodstock needed for future production.\nKing salmon fishing in Lena Cove remains open:\n\nThe daily bag and possession limit is four king salmon of any size;\nKing salmon harvested by nonresidents in this area do not count toward their annual limit.\n\n\nFish Creek Pond – (CLOSED June 24)\nKing salmon returning to Fish Creek Pond will be used to supplement what is returning to the hatchery. Both sources will be needed to achieve broodstock goals to maintain future production. This sport fishing closure will allow fish to gather and remain in the pond undisturbed. At the end of July, king salmon in the pond will be captured and used to help achieve broodstock needs.\n\nClosed to sport fishing for all species\n\n\nLink to emergency orders\nSoutheast Regionwide King Salmon Sport Fishing Regulations - (OPEN JUNE 15 in Juneau Area)\nAlaskan resident:\n\nThe resident bag and possession limit is two king salmon, 28 inches or greater in length;\n\nNonresident:\n\nThe nonresident bag and possession limit is one king salmon, 28 inches or greater in length;\nJanuary 1st – June 30th, the nonresident annual harvest limit is three king salmon, 28 inches or greater in length;\nJuly 1st – July 15th, the nonresident annual harvest limit is two king salmon, 28 inches or greater in length; any king salmon harvested from January 1 through June 30 will apply towards the two fish annual harvest limit;\nJuly 16th – December 31st, the nonresident annual harvest limit is one king salmon, 28 inches or greater in length; any king salmon harvested from January 1 through July 15 will apply towards the one fish annual harvest limit;\nImmediately upon landing and retaining a king salmon, a nonresident must enter the species, date, and location on the back of their sport fishing license or on a nontransferable harvest record;\n\nThe Southeast regionwide bag and possession limits above will apply in all areas except as modified below for the inside waters in the vicinity of Juneau:\nMarine waters near Juneau except Seymour Canal and upper Taku Inlet: (The waters of District 9 north of a line from Patterson Pt. to Pt.

This event is free for everybody and ADF&G will have staff on hand to loan out rods and lures so anyone can join in the fun of casting from shore and hopefully hooking a big salmon. This event will also include the US Forest Service and Trout Unlimited. In addition to the fishing there will be other activities and giveaways at Lena Cove this Saturday. Rain or shine we will be there so please dress for the weather and we look forward to seeing you all this Saturday for the Family Fishing Day event.\nSalmon\nMost of the Chinook salmon should have already migrated upstream to their natal streams, but there have been some harvested in the only remaining open terminal area, Lena Cove, and off the backside of Douglas near Young’s Bay. Early-run Coho salmon started their migration towards Juneau's waters, where anglers are finding success near Point Retreat and Homeshore.\nIf you're looking to fish closer to home, Chum salmon are abundant throughout Juneau waters, particularly around the Breadline and the backside of Douglas. We're noticing scattered small numbers of Pink salmon throughout the Juneau area as well, which is typical for an even year.\nMarine boat anglers looking to go king salmon fishing in the Juneau area could troll using flashers, spoons, or herring rigs. Here are some recommendations on king salmon tackle and gear set-ups for both shoreside and marine boat anglers.\nJuneau Hatchery Area Remains CLOSED \nPlease take a moment to view the Hatchery King Salmon Regulations map below.

However, there have been a few caught off the Breadline and on the backside of Douglas Island. The good news is that Coho salmon have started to show up! We are beginning to see a lot of success near the Breadline, with smaller numbers being caught off North Shelter, Lincoln Island, Pt. Retreat, and on the backside of Douglas Island.\nThe Chum salmon catch is slowly declining as they return to their natal streams to spawn. However, there are still small amounts being harvested near North Shelter, Lincoln Island, Pt. Retreat, and the Breadline. Additionally, we're noticing scattered small numbers of Pink salmon throughout the Juneau area, which is typical for an even year.\nMarine boat anglers looking to go king salmon fishing in the Juneau area could troll using flashers, spoons, or herring rigs. Here are some recommendations on king salmon tackle and gear set-ups for both shoreside and marine boat anglers.\nJuneau Hatchery Area Remains CLOSED \nPlease take a moment to view the Hatchery King Salmon Regulations map below. The area has been closed since June 24th. This closure is necessary to protect broodstock required for future production. The closures in the hatchery area and at Fish Creek Pond will aid in collecting broodstock to meet egg-take goals. Be sure to check this advisory announcement.\nAuke Bay, Fritz Cove, Gastineau Channel \nWithin the designated saltwater hatchery sport harvest area consisting of the contiguous waters of Stephens Passage, Auke Bay, Fritz Cove and Gastineau Channel, enclosed on the west by a line running from the tip of Point Louisa to the navigational aid at the northern tip of Portland Island (58 o 21.13’N., 134 o 45.52’W) then along the eastern shore of Portland Island to its most southern point and ending on Douglas Island at the northern tip of Outer Point, and enclosed on the east by a line located approximately ¼ mile south of the Dupont dock and extending across Gastineau Channel between department markers (see attached map #1).\n\nClosed to king salmon fishing, king salmon may not be targeted or retained.\n\nMacaulay Hatchery\nThe salt waters of Gastineau Channel within a 300-yard radius of the Wayside Park Fishing Dock (Channel Wayside fishing dock – see attached map #1 insert).\n\nClosed to king salmon fishing and snagging for all species.\n\nKing salmon returning to the Douglas Island Pink and Chum, Inc. Macaulay Salmon Hatchery are not expected to meet broodstock goals this year. The return of hatchery produced king salmon to Juneau waters appears to be low based on the number of tag recoveries to date. Therefore, these closures are necessary to protect broodstock needed for future production.\nKing salmon fishing in Lena Cove remains open:\n\nThe daily bag and possession limit is four king salmon of any size;\nKing salmon harvested by nonresidents in this area do not count toward their annual limit.\n\n\nFish Creek Pond Remains CLOSED To All Sport Fishing\nKing salmon returning to Fish Creek Pond will be used to supplement what is returning to the hatchery. Both sources will be needed to achieve broodstock goals to maintain future production. This sport fishing closure will allow fish to gather and remain in the pond undisturbed. At the end of July, king salmon in the pond will be captured and used to help achieve broodstock needs.\n\nClosed to sport fishing for all species\n\n\nLink to emergency orders\nSoutheast Regionwide King Salmon Sport Fishing Regulations - (Outside of the Hatchery Areas)\nAlaskan resident:\n\nThe resident bag and possession limit is two king salmon, 28 inches or greater in length;\n\nNonresident:\n\nThe nonresident bag and possession limit is one king salmon, 28 inches or greater in length;\nJuly 16th – December 31st, the nonresident annual harvest limit is one king salmon, 28 inches or greater in length; any king salmon harvested from January 1 through July 15 will apply towards the one fish annual harvest limit;\nImmediately upon landing and retaining a king salmon, a nonresident must enter the species, date, and location on the back of their sport fishing license or on a nontransferable harvest record;\n\nOther Summer Fishing Opportunities\nDolly Varden and cutthroat trout Fishing\nIn mid-summer, Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout start migrating into local creeks, trailing adult salmon to their spawning grounds in search of salmon eggs to feed on. The most effective methods for catching these fish are using egg patterns, small spinners, or spoons. Don't forget to visit Go Fish AK and explore the interactive map to identify the species you're interested in fishing for.\nIn all drainages crossed by the Juneau road system, as well as the saltwater adjacent to the Juneau road system to a line ¼ mile offshore, cutthroat and rainbow trout bag limits (in combination) are 2 daily, 2 in possession with a 14-inch minimum and 22-inch maximum size limit.

We’re seeing notable success near the Breadline, Pt. Retreat, and the backside of Douglas Island. Fewer Coho are being caught off North Shelter and Lincoln Island. Although Chinook salmon harvest has decreased, anglers are still reeling in a few kings off the Breadline and the backside of Douglas Island.\nMost Chum salmon have now returned to freshwater habitats, though some are still being caught in saltwater. As they transition, their distinctive calico markings are becoming increasingly prominent. This year’s Chum salmon run has been exceptionally strong, resulting in numerous freshwater streams being densely populated with spawning fish.

Since its inception in 1947, this cherished summer fishing event has brought together people of all ages and backgrounds for a weekend of fun and community spirit. Whether you're an avid angler or just looking to support a great cause, join in the quest for king and coho salmon.\nRemember to purchase your derby ticket to participate—tickets are available at DeHart's, Sportsman's Warehouse, or Western Auto Marine. Join for a fantastic weekend of fishing and camaraderie!\nSalmon\nOver the past few weeks, coho salmon activity has shown a steady increase. Anglers are finding success near North Shelter and Lincoln Island, Pt. Retreat, Funter Bay, and the backside of Douglas Island. While catches have been lighter off the Breadline, St. James Bay, and south Shelter Island, there are still opportunities to enjoy a successful outing throughout the region. Although Chinook salmon harvest has decreased, anglers are still reeling in a few kings off the backside of Douglas Island, and around Benjamin Island.\nMost chum salmon have now returned to freshwater habitats, and very few are still being caught in saltwater. As they transition, their distinctive calico markings are becoming increasingly prominent. This year’s chum salmon run has been exceptionally strong, resulting in numerous freshwater streams being densely populated with spawning fish. We’re also observing scattered groups of pink salmon around Pt. Retreat, as well as near North Shelter, Lincoln Island, the Breadline, Funter Bay and the backside of Douglas Island.\nMarine boat anglers looking to go king salmon fishing in the Juneau area could troll using flashers, spoons, or herring rigs. Here are some recommendations on king salmon tackle and gear set-ups for both shoreside and marine boat anglers.\nJuneau Hatchery Area Remains CLOSED \nPlease take a moment to view the Hatchery King Salmon Regulations map below. The area has been closed since June 24th. This closure is necessary to protect broodstock required for future production. The closures in the hatchery area will aid in collecting broodstock to meet egg-take goals. Be sure to check this advisory announcement.\nAuke Bay, Fritz Cove, Gastineau Channel \nWithin the designated saltwater hatchery sport harvest area consisting of the contiguous waters of Stephens Passage, Auke Bay, Fritz Cove and Gastineau Channel, enclosed on the west by a line running from the tip of Point Louisa to the navigational aid at the northern tip of Portland Island (58 o 21.13’N., 134 o 45.52’W) then along the eastern shore of Portland Island to its most southern point and ending on Douglas Island at the northern tip of Outer Point, and enclosed on the east by a line located approximately ¼ mile south of the Dupont dock and extending across Gastineau Channel between department markers (see attached map #1).\n\nClosed to king salmon fishing, king salmon may not be targeted or retained.\n\nMacaulay Hatchery\nThe salt waters of Gastineau Channel within a 300-yard radius of the Wayside Park Fishing Dock (Channel Wayside fishing dock – see attached map #1 insert).\n\nClosed to king salmon fishing and snagging for all species.\n\nKing salmon returning to the Douglas Island Pink and Chum, Inc. Macaulay Salmon Hatchery are not expected to meet broodstock goals this year. The return of hatchery produced king salmon to Juneau waters appears to be low based on the number of tag recoveries to date. Therefore, these closures are necessary to protect broodstock needed for future production.\nKing salmon fishing in Lena Cove remains open:\n\nThe daily bag and possession limit is four king salmon of any size;\nKing salmon harvested by nonresidents in this area do not count toward their annual limit.\n\n\nFish Creek Pond Will Be Open to Sport Fishing August 10\nThe Fish Creek Pond sport fishing closure will be removed August 10. The hatchery efforts for collecting king salmon in the Pond needed for broodstock will conclude August 8, making the closure no longer necessary.\nWithin Fish Creek Pond the following regulations will be in effect beginning 12:01 a.m. Saturday, August 10 through 11:59 p.m. Saturday, August 31, 2024:\n\nThe daily bag and possession limit is four king salmon of any size,\nKing salmon harvested by nonresidents in the Fish Creek Pond area do not count toward their annual limit,\nThe use of bait, weighted hooks and lures, and multiple hooks with a gap between point and shank larger than one-half inch are permitted,\nKing salmon hooked elsewhere than in the mouth may be retained.\n\nLink to emergency orders\nSoutheast Regionwide King Salmon Sport Fishing Regulations - (Outside of the Hatchery Areas)\nAlaskan resident:\n\nThe resident bag and possession limit is two king salmon, 28 inches or greater in length;\n\nNonresident:\n\nThe nonresident bag and possession limit is one king salmon, 28 inches or greater in length;\nJuly 16th – December 31st, the nonresident annual harvest limit is one king salmon, 28 inches or greater in length; any king salmon harvested from January 1 through July 15 will apply towards the one fish annual harvest limit;\nImmediately upon landing and retaining a king salmon, a nonresident must enter the species, date, and location on the back of their sport fishing license or on a nontransferable harvest record;\n\nOther Summer Fishing Opportunities\nDolly Varden and cutthroat trout Fishing\nIn mid-summer, Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout start migrating into local creeks, trailing adult salmon to their spawning grounds in search of salmon eggs and decaying salmon to feed on. The most effective methods for catching these fish are using egg patterns, small spinners, or spoons. Don't forget to visit Go Fish AK and explore the interactive map to identify the species you're interested in fishing for.\nIn all drainages crossed by the Juneau road system, as well as the saltwater adjacent to the Juneau road system to a line ¼ mile offshore, cutthroat and rainbow trout bag limits (in combination) are 2 daily, 2 in possession with a 14-inch minimum and 22-inch maximum size limit. Dolly Varden limits are 2 daily, 2 in possession, no size limit. Anglers should check the 2024 Southeast Alaska Sport Fish Regulation Summary or special regulations specific to the stream or lake they intend to fish.\nHalibut\nThroughout the halibut season, catches have remained steady over the past few weeks. Recent reports highlight that anglers have had the most success off North Shelter, Lincoln Island, and Benjamin Island. These areas are consistently producing good results, so if you're planning a trip, these spots could be your best bet for a successful haul.\nIt's important to note that halibut fishing is federally managed. For detailed information on sport fishing regulations and guidelines for charter (guided) vs unguided halibut regulations in Southeast Alaska, please visit NOAA’s website.\nSablefish (Black Cod)\nWe’re beginning to see a few sablefish around Pt. Retreat and Benjamin Island.

King salmon may not be retained or possessed, any king salmon caught must be released immediately and returned to the water unharmed. These regulations will be in effect through September 30, 2024. The king salmon sport fishery will reopen on October 1, 2024 for the winter season, a future announcement will be issued in late September.\nCoho Salmon\nWe've seen a few small bursts of coho salmon activity over the past month, but it looks like they’re finally starting to show up in good numbers! Anglers are having the most success near Pt. Retreat, North Shelter, Lincoln Island, Funter Bay, and the backside of Douglas Island. Catches are fairly consistent throughout the region, so there are still opportunities for a successful outing at various other spots. For those fishing from shore, try Sheep Creek; success should improve there and throughout Gastineau Channel and continue to get better over the next few weeks. The hatchery coho return is projected to be pretty strong so anglers should find success throughout the next few weeks.\nFreshwater Coho Fishing CLOSED in Peterson Creek and Montana Creek beginning September 1\n\nThe waters of Montana Creek, including McGinnis Creek, are CLOSED to coho salmon fishing. Coho salmon may not be targeted, retained, or possessed.\nThe waters of Peterson Creek, including Peterson Lagoon, from intertidal waters within a 200-yard radius of the creek mouth at salt water to the falls approximately 1.5 miles upstream are CLOSED to coho salmon fishing.

However, the Terminal Harvest Area will open on June 1st, offering some early-season opportunities. The broader area will reopen to king salmon retention starting June 15th.\nFor comprehensive details on specific areas, including maps, bag limits, and possession regulations, please refer to our latest advisory announcements and emergency orders. Stay informed on the most current regulations and any recent changes.\nCreel Samplers Are Now on The Docks!\nMarine boat anglers returning to docks where ADF&G creel sampling is occurring (Juneau is included in this area): from now through September 14, 2025, you may not fillet, mutilate, or de-head sport-caught lingcod, nonpelagic rockfish, and king or coho salmon at sea. These fish must remain whole until your vessel is tied up at a docking facility where the fish will be offloaded, unless they’ve been consumed or preserved on board.\nThe purpose of this restriction is to maximize the information collected through ADF&G creel sampling and angler interviews—critical data that helps manage and sustain our fisheries.\nADF&G creel samplers will be present on the docks, so please be patient and respectful as they carry out this important work.\nOther Summer Fishing Opportunities\nDolly Varden and cutthroat trout Fishing\nAs temperatures rise and ice melts across Southeast Alaska, spring marks the return of active Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout. These anadromous fish migrate from their over-wintering lakes and ponds to feed in saltwater, especially around lake outlets and stream mouths. Shoreline fishing in coastal areas becomes productive as they congregate at creek mouths to feed on salmon smolts. Small spoons, spinners, and smolt-imitating flies are effective for targeting these fish during this active period.\nIn all drainages crossed by the Juneau road system, as well as the saltwater adjacent to the Juneau road system to a line ¼ mile offshore, cutthroat and rainbow trout bag limits (in combination) are 2 daily, 2 in possession with a 14-inch minimum and 22-inch maximum size limit. Dolly Varden limits are 2 daily, 2 in possession, no size limit. Anglers should check the 2025 Southeast Alaska Sport Fish Regulation Summary or special regulations specific to the stream or lake they intend to fish.\nHalibut\nIt’s still a little early for halibut fishing in the Juneau area. Most of the fish are still holding out on the coast, and current catch rates remain a bit low. That said, anglers can expect more halibut to move into local waters as the summer progresses—so stay patient and be ready as the season picks up!\nIt's important to note that halibut fishing is federally managed. For detailed information on sport fishing regulations and guidelines for charter (guided) vs unguided halibut regulations in Southeast Alaska, please visit NOAA’s website.\nRockfish\nDeepwater release devices are mandatory for all saltwater vessels.

These fish must remain whole until your vessel is tied up at a docking facility where the fish will be offloaded, unless they’ve been consumed or preserved on board.\nThe purpose of this restriction is to maximize the information collected through ADF&G creel sampling and angler interviews—critical data that helps manage and sustain our fisheries. ADF&G creel samplers will be present on the docks, so please be patient and respectful as they carry out this important work.\nHalibut\nIt's still a bit early in the season for peak halibut action around Juneau, as many fish are still holding out along the outer coast.

While most of the early-season action was concentrated in the southern portion of the THA, the bite has now shifted north.\nAnglers are currently having the most success in areas like Lena Cove and the North Douglas/Fritz Cove area, which have become the latest hot spots. The south end of Gastineau Channel is still producing a few fish, but not at the pace seen earlier in the season.\nIn addition to kings, we’re starting to see a good number of coho showing up on the docks! Anglers are harvesting cohos from Pt. Retreat, North Shelter and Lincoln Islands, Funter Bay, and around Benjamin Island. Chums and pinks are also coming in, with most of them being caught in the same areas where coho are being found.\nOverall, the season is in full swing and fishing opportunities continue to be strong in the Juneau area.\nFishing Inside the THA\nThe Juneau area is fortunate to have a THA where both residents and nonresidents can continue to harvest king salmon within the designated boundaries. It is important to note that sport fishing for king salmon and all snagging is prohibited within a 300-yard radius of the Wayside Park Fishing Dock to protect salmon attempting to reach the fish ladder at the Macaulay Salmon Hatchery.\nBag & Possession Limits (Inside the THA):\n\nAll anglers bag and possession limit is four king salmon of any size;\nKing salmon harvested by nonresidents in the designated saltwater hatchery sport harvest area do not count toward their annual limit.\n\nMarine Waters Outside the Hatchery Area\n\nResident anglers bag and possession limit is one king salmon, 28 inches or greater in length;\nNonresident anglers king salmon may not be retained or possessed; any king salmon caught must be released immediately and returned to the water unharmed;\nAll anglers may not retain king salmon within the exclusive economic zone (3-200 nautical miles from shore).\n\nFor comprehensive details on specific areas, including maps, bag limits, and possession regulations, please refer to our latest  advisory announcements and emergency orders. Stay informed on the most current regulations and any recent changes.\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing is in full swing, and anglers are having solid success throughout the Juneau area.

All vessels must have at least one functional deepwater release mechanism on board and readily available for use when sport fishing activities are taking place regardless of species targeted.\nAll rockfish not retained must be released at the depth they were caught or 100 feet, whichever is shallower.\nPlease visit our link to view deep water release device examples and tips and how these mechanisms are a helpful tool for conservation.\nAnglers are beginning to see more consistent rockfish catches around the Juneau area, coinciding with the recent uptick in halibut fishing. Duskies have made up the bulk of the reports so far, with a few Silvergray, Rougheye, Quillback, Redbanded, and Yelloweye rockfish also starting to show up on the docks. Most of these rockfish have been caught in the waters near North Shelter, Lincoln Island, Benjamin Island, and Point Retreat. As always, please follow current regulations and handle any released fish with care to help support the long-term health of these valuable stocks.\nPelagic Rockfish\n\nAll anglers: 3 per day, 6 in possession, no size limit.\nPelagic rockfish include, Black, Dark, Deacon, Dusky, Widow and Yellowtail rockfish.\n\nNonpelagic rockfish (demersal shelf & and slope rockfish)\n\n\nDemersal shelf rockfish (Yelloweye, Quillback, Tiger, China, Canary, Copper and Rosethorn rockfish)\n\nAlaska residents: 1 per day, 2 in possession, no size limit.\nNonresidents:\n\nSeason: July 1 – August 25;\n1 daily, 1 in possession, annual limit of ONE fish.\nImmediately upon landing and retaining a demersal shelf rockfish, a nonresident must enter the species, date and location on the back of their sport fishing license or on a nontransferable harvest record.\n\n\n\n\n\nSlope rockfish (Blackgill, Blackspotted, Blue, Bocaccio, Brown, Chilipepper, Darkblotched, Greenstriped, Harlequin, Northern, Pacific Ocean Perch, PugetSound, Pygmy, Redstripe, Redbanded, Rougheye, Sharpchin, Shortbelly, Shortraker, Silvergray, Splitnose, Stripetail, Vermilion, and Yellowmouth)\n\nAll anglers: 1 per day, 2 in possession, no size limit.\n\n\n\nNot all rockfish species found in Alaska are listed above. For a complete list of species you may encounter in Alaska, please visit our website.\nDolly Varden and cutthroat trout Fishing\nIn mid-summer, Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout have begun moving into local creeks to feast on salmon eggs. The best way to catch these fish is by using egg patterns or small spinners and spoons. Make sure to visit Go Fish AK and explore the interactive map to identify the species you're interested in fishing for.\nIn all drainages crossed by the Juneau road system, as well as the saltwater adjacent to the Juneau road system to a line 1/4 mile offshore, cutthroat and rainbow trout bag limits (in combination) are 2 daily, 2 in possession with a 14-inch minimum and 22-inch maximum size limit. Dolly Varden limits are 2 daily, 2 in possession, no size limit.

To participate, anglers must hold a valid sport fishing license along with a 2025/2026 Southeast Alaska Regional Personal Use King Crab Permit. These are available at the ADF&G online store. Please check for Personal Use Emergency Orders, legal-size and pot configurations, and restrictions online. Section 11-A is currently CLOSED to Alaskan resident PU king crab fishing. Stay tuned for the Juneau area PU announcement later this year using the link above. Harvest must be reported online. Please check the 2025 Southeast Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary booklet pages 34-37 for regulations specific to shellfish.\nDungeness and Tanner Crab\nFor Alaskan residents in the Juneau area, licensed anglers may retain up to 20 male Dungeness crabs, with a minimum width of 6 1/2 inches and 30 male Tanner crabs, with a minimum width of 5 1/2 inches. While taking Dungeness crab, 5 pots or 10 rings per person may be used, with a max of 10 pots or 20 rings per vessel. While taking Tanner crab, no more than 4 pots or 10 rings per vessel may be used. In total, no more than 5 pots per person and 10 pots per vessel may be used for taking shellfish regardless of pot type.\nFor nonresidents in the Juneau area, licensed anglers can keep 3 male Tanner and Dungeness crab (in combination). Tanner males need to be 5 1/2 inch minimum width and Dungeness males need to be 6 1/2 inch minimum width.\nShrimp\nSport and personal use shrimp fisheries in the Juneau and Tenakee area will remain CLOSED until further notice. The closed area consists of all marine waters of Section 11-A north and west of a line extending from a regulatory marker near point Bishop to the Coast Guard marker and light on Point Arden, extending to a line at the latitude of Little Island light, and east of a line from Little Island light to Point Retreat light. And the Tenakee closed area consists of all marine waters in Tenakee Inlet west of the longitude of Corner Point at 135° 06.50' W long. Check the Sport and Personal Use Advisory Announcement,\nOutside the Juneau 11-A and Tenakee Inlet areas, sport and personal use shrimp fishing remains open. Sport and personal use shrimpers who have a valid sport fishing license must also have a free shrimp permit available on the ADF&G online store. Participating anglers must sign their permit in ink to make it valid and have the permit in possession while taking shrimp in Southeast Alaska. Shrimp limits and gear requirements for sport and personal use shrimp fishing cab be found on pages 34-37 of the 2025 Southeast Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary. Reporting of effort and harvest is required and must be submitted to the department even if you did not fish.\nClams\nADF&G does not recommend harvesting clams from any waters in the Juneau area due to the possibility that the clams may contain Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) toxins. Currently, no beaches in the Juneau area are monitored on a regular basis (i.e- \"certified\") for PSP toxins. If you harvest, you do so at your own risk of PSP poisoning. Sporadic sampling has been conducted by the Southeast Alaska Tribal Ocean Research (SEATOR) project, but clams of any species and at any time during the year may still contain toxic levels of PSP. Please navigate to the following Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) web page for more information about PSP.\nInteractive Fishing Location Maps\nCheck out the wefishak page on the ADF&G website for the new Juneau-Glacier Bay Interactive Map to discover popular fishing locations and information on species run timing, fishing gear selections, and boat and angler access tips through the Sport Fish gofishak application."

Low water levels are making fish spook easily and difficult to catch but expect things to heat up after the next rainfall. Peak run timing varies by river system, with most runs peaking in late April. Fishing for steelhead should remain steady in most systems until early May.\nBe sure to check the 2024 Southeast Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations. The Ketchikan Area Freshwater Special Regulations can be found on pages 30-32. Regulations vary depending on the waters you plan to fish.\nTrout and Dolly Varden\nAs water levels increase trout and dollies will make their way out of the lakes and begin heading up stream towards spawning habitat. Excellent trout fishing has been reported along roadside systems. Expect this period of warm, sunny weather to heat up the streams and lead to aggressive fish. Try egg or fry imitations to match the natural forage this time of year.\nKing Salmon\nOpportunity to harvest king salmon will be available in terminal harvest areas beginning in June. On June 15, most of the Ketchikan area (District 1) and east Prince of Wales area (District 2) will open with regional king salmon limits, with a few exceptions. Please see the advisory announcements issued March 28 and April 2, 2024.\nHalibut\nHalibut can be targeted this time of year and fishing will continue to improve as summer approaches. Reminder: Filleting halibut: No person shall possess on board a vessel, including charter vessels and pleasure craft used for fishing, halibut that have been filleted, mutilated, or otherwise disfigured in any manner, except that each halibut may be cut into no more than 2 ventral pieces, 2 dorsal pieces, and 2 cheek pieces, with enough skin on each piece to identify whether the piece is from the light side or the dark side of the fish.\nLingcod\nSportfishing for lingcod is currently closed. The season will start on May 16. Reminder: the lingcod slot limit for nonresidents has changed this year.\n\nResidents: 1 daily, 2 in possession, no size limit.\nNonresidents: 1 daily, 1 in possession, size limit 30 to 35 inches or 55 inches or greater.

This will impact all waters in the Ketchikan Management Area except for the Herring Bay Terminal Harvest Area, which will remain open through July 31. The regional closure is necessary to keep the sport fishery within the 2025 sport allocation.\nKing salmon fishing has been strong, with the latter half of June and early July typically considered the peak period.

In order to not exceed the 2025 sport allocation of king salmon this closure is necessary.\nThe closure does not impact resident anglers. Starting July 15th, the remaining saltwater portion of the Petersburg/Wrangell area will open to resident anglers for king salmon retention with a bag and possession limit of one over 28 inches.Traditionally king salmon catches slow down over the next few weeks but they may still be caught.\nThere are separate regulations for the Blind Slough/Wrangell Narrows Terminal Harvest Area, City Creek, and the remainder of the region. Please see the Advisory Announcement on our website for maps and more specific information about each of these locations. Remember that a king salmon stamp is required whenever fishing for king salmon (including catch and release).\nSockeye salmon are in the saltwater now and entering some local streams. Fishing for them may be slow as they are not aggressive feeders and as such catch rates should be expectedly low. Anglers are reminded that snagging is not allowed in any area freshwaters where sockeye salmon are found.\nPink and Coho salmon should begin to show. Area coho fishing in marine waters traditionally gets going around the third week in July but there have been some early catches up north so we may see them sooner.\nHalibut\nHalibut catch rates tend to remain consistent in July and this is a good species to target this time of year. If looking for halibut locations, target high points under the water that come up to as shallow 100 feet. Another option might be offshore of a creek that has salmon spawning. Halibut catch rates should increase as they come into shallow waters over the summer. Traditional fishing areas such as The Eye Opener in Sumner Strait or north of town in Frederick Sound hold the most promise. Large halibut tend to be at 300 feet or greater, try to fish the slack tides with heavy duty gear and use whole herring for bait. If you are in Petersburg fishing from a small skiff and need to stay close to town, fish just south of the red buoy just outside of Wrangell Narrows in 300 to 400 feet of water.\nThe Halibut sport fishery is open February 1 – December 31, 2025. Reminder: Filleting halibut: No person shall possess on board a vessel, including charter vessels and pleasure craft used for fishing, halibut that have been filleted, mutilated, or otherwise disfigured in any manner, except that each halibut may be cut into no more than 2 ventral pieces, 2 dorsal pieces, and 2 cheek pieces, with enough skin on each piece to identify whether the piece is from the light side or the dark side of the fish.\nLingcod\nResidents are allowed a daily bag limit of 1; 2 in possession. Nonresidents are allowed a daily bag limit of 1; 1 in possession; 30-35 inches or 55 inches and longer. There is an annual limit of 2 fish, 1 of which is 30-35 inches in length, and 1 that is 55 inches or greater in length. A harvest record is required. The Northern Southeast Area is closed to nonresidents for lingcod fishing from June 15 - August 15, 2025.\nRockfish\nRockfish regulations have changed since the last fishing season. The retention of demersal shelf rockfish, including yelloweye, is open for residents of Alaska with a daily bag limit of 1; 2 in possession. Demersal shelf rockfish, including yelloweye, will be open for nonresidents from July 1 through August 25 with an annual limit of 1 fish. Slope Rockfish are open to resident and nonresidents with a daily bag limit of 1; 1 in possession. Pelagic Rockfish are open to resident and nonresidents with a daily bag limit of 3; 6 in possession. A helpful species identification guide has been published on the ADFG website. Anglers are reminded that a rockfish release device is now required to be used whenever releasing rockfish, and a rockfish release device must be onboard your vessel whenever sport fishing in marine waters.\nDolly Varden and Trout\nResident cutthroat and Dolly Varden can also be found in area streams and lakes accessible by the Petersburg and Wrangell road systems. Often overlooked by anglers with their sites on salmon, these smaller fish can offer plenty of fun on lighter tackle. July is a good time to catch these fish, though depending on where you are at you might have to avoid the pink salmon that will fill the streams.\nCreel Samplers\nAlaska Department of Fish and Game creel samplers have been on the public docks since mid-May approaching anglers to ask about their catch. The biological samples they collect are used to help manage and sustain a healthy stock required for recreational angling. Please be courteous and provide them with the few minutes needed to gather this important information."

Kings are also returning to the Medvejie Hatchery and Silver Bay. Currently, there are no special regulations for kings returning to Medvejie or Silver Bay (regional regulations apply). There is a small area near the barrier net behind the net pens at Medvejie that is now closed to fishing in order to allow hatchery staff access to broodstock. Signs are posted. Resident Anglers are allowed one king daily with no annual limit. The nonresident king fishery is closed as of July 7th.\nFor other salmon: Coho are starting to show up offshore and there have been reports of them being large for this early. Chum have also recently shown in Sitka Sound in force. Sockeye salmon are starting off strong. As of 7/6, over 39,900 have passed through the Redoubt Weir. It’s still early for Pink Salmon.\nFishing in the EEZ\nOne of the substantial changes for fishing this year is that resident anglers must comply with nonresident fishing regulations when fishing in the EEZ. The EEZ or Exclusive Economic Zone is the water that is generally from 3 miles offshore out to 200 miles. There are some exceptions to this (like Sitka Sound) where there’s an imaginary line that cuts across the sound from offshore of Biorka to Cape Edgcumbe. There are maps depicting this in the 2025 regulatory summary on p. 10 and posted at most of the harbors. While this doesn’t affect nonresidents (there is no differentiation between state waters and the EEZ for nonresidents) resident anglers must comply with nonresident regulations when fishing in the EEZ. This includes any size, bag, or annual limits. Further, anglers may not be in possession of a fish that would be otherwise illegal to possess in the waters in which they are fishing. For example, if a resident angler caught a 45 inch lingcod in state waters (after May 15th), they could not then go out to the EEZ and fish for any species because nonresident anglers are limited to one lingcod between 30 and 35 inches.\nResident anglers are subject to and must record any harvest of species that has an annual limit when fishing in the EEZ. This will include king salmon, lingcod, and nonpelagic rockfish in addition to steelhead and sharks (which must be recorded in state waters as well).\nHalibut\nFishing for halibut is open. Fishing for halibut is good and stays relatively consistent through the summer. These fish will begin to show up in greater numbers as weather warms and other fisheries move more inshore. See NOAA for sport fishing regulations.\nLingcod\nFor all anglers, the fishing season opened May 16. The resident season will run through the end of November. There is a midseason closure for nonresident anglers From June 15th through August 15. Fishing for lingcod has been good.\nDemersal Shelf Rockfish (DSR)\nIn 2025, Demersal Shelf Rockfish (DSR) is open year-round for residents. Residents are allowed one fish daily with no annual limit (in State Waters). Nonresidents are allowed one DSR daily and one annually from July 1-August 25. Here’s a helpful rockfish Id link to common rockfish groups. DSR are a subset of nonpelagic rockfish including: Yelloweye, Quillback, China, Tiger, Rosethorn, Copper, and Canary.\nSlope Rockfish\nAll anglers are allowed one daily, two in possession all year with no annual limit. The most common slope rockfish include: Redbanded, Rougheye, Silvergray, Shortraker, and Vermilion.\nPelagic Rockfish\nFishing for pelagic rockfish is open all year and typically good year-round. The most commonly caught pelagic rockfish in the Sitka Area are the Black and Yellowtail, although Duskys aren’t uncommon. Try fishing around underwater structures near kelp beds with a dart or jig. These rockfish make for excellent table fare.\nAnglers are allowed five daily, ten in possession, with the exception of CSEO (Sitka Area), where residents are allowed three a day, six in possession, and nonresidents are allowed two daily, four in possession. See the Sitka Area Special Exceptions for a map of CSEO on page 25 of the 2025 Southeast Regulation Summary. The department has developed a guide to assist anglers in identifying species groupings. If you’d like a copy of this on waterproof paper, stop by the office for a free one.\nShellfish\nBe sure to check your local fishing regulations to be aware of harvest limits, size requirements and necessary permits for shellfish. Also be aware that certain types of shellfish in Southeast Alaska have been known to cause Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) which can be fatal.\nFor Dungeness crab, try placing pots in bays and around the mouths of river where crabs congregate to feed. If fishing with friends, be sure to keep each angler’s catch separate to avoid pooling bag limits.\nCheck out the new gofishak interactive map to discover popular fishing locations and information on species run timing, fishing gear selections, and boat and angler access tips!\nFor further information, please feel free to contact the Sitka area sportfish management staff at (907) 747-5355."

Water levels are normal and have made fishing quite good. Weir counts have us tracking above the escapement goal range, with over 40,000 fish estimated to have gone past the weir so far at roughly 48% of the run historically. As a result, the bag limit for sockeye salmon on the Situk River has increased from 3 per day to 6 per day. Fish are spread through out the river. The Situk River within 50 yards of both upstream/downstream of the 9-mile Bridge is closed to sport fishing.\nDolly Varden\nDolly fishing should be excellent. Large numbers of Dolly Varden are present in the Situk River and other freshwaters in the Yakutat management area. They are feasting on emigrating pink salmon fry, and salmon smolt. Almost any lure or fly can be used to catch them. Try mimicking salmon smolt or fry when choosing a lure.\nCutthroat Trout\nCutthroat trout fishing continues to be excellent right now. The best location to target them is Tawah Creek. The Tawah Creek within 50 yards of both upstream/downstream of the Cannon Beach Road Bridge is closed to sport fishing. They are spread throughout the drainage and are similar to Dolly Varden in that you can use a variety of lures or flies to target them.\nSaltwaters\nKing Salmon\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters. Fishing for kings this last week was very slow. Fishing for king salmon closed to non-resident anglers on Monday, July 7th. Most anglers troll spoons or herring behind a flasher. Please check the department website below for the recent emergency order and advisory announcements regarding 2025 regional king salmon regulations for Southeast Alaska.\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing this past week was good, however more smaller fish continue to be caught compared to earlier in the season, however some really nice fish are being caught for those who can get out farther offshore. The marine weather has been good for the most part and has allowed anglers to get out to wherever they want to this last week, with most anglers going out front of Yakutat Bay. Dogfish are present, so moving around to avoid them might be necessary. We are in the middle of the halibut season, so fishing should remain good for the next month or so. The forecast looks a little rough next week with rain and wind event scattered throughout. Anglers are anchoring up and soaking herring/octopus/salmon heads on circle hooks or using baited jigs as they drift.\nLingcod\nLingcod fishing is open in the Yakutat area. Fishing has been excellent so far. Please check the department website for the recent emergency order and advisory annoucements regarding changes to lingcod regulations in the Yakutat management area. Using a variety of jigs (lead-head, dart) over rocky structures is the best method for catching lingcod, although a double snelled octopus hook set-up baited with herring works well too.\nRockfish\nFishing for rockfish is good in the Yakutat area. Dart jigs or mooching with herring over rocky pinnacles works best. Please check the department website for the recent emergency order and advisory annoucements regarding changes to rockfish regulations in 2025 for Southeast Alaska.\nFor further information, please get in touch with the Yakutat Area Sport Fish management biologist Jason Pawluk at (907) 784-3222.\nEmergency orders can be found on our website.\nCheck out the new gofishak interactive map to discover popular fishing locations and information on species run timing, fishing gear selections, and boat and angler access tips!"

Responsible anglers should take active steps to reduce human-bear conflicts. Teach bears that angles do not make an easy meal!\nSplashing fish attract bears:\n\nIf a bear is nearby, stop fishing.\nIf the bear approaches while you have a fish on the line, give it slack or cut the line to eliminate splashing.\n\nWhen you catch a fish:\n\nBring your fish from the river to your vehicle.\nCoolers are not bear proof, so keep it in your vehicle.\nIf using a stringer, keep it near you and do not leave it if approached by a bear.\n\nFish remains attract bears:\n\nDon’t leave fish scraps on the bank, toss them into deep, fast flowing water or use designated fish cleaning stations\n\nKeep fish and gear closely attended and don’t leave it if approached by a bear.\nFall Fishing Opportunities - Fresh Water\nCoho (silver) salmon\nCoho are beginning to trickle into Chilkoot river! Anglers will have increasing chances of catching silvers through September and into early October.\nA few silvers have been captured by department crews in Chilkat lake. Fishing will pick up on the Chilkat near the end of September and into October. Try targeting clearwater tributaries where they merge into the Chilkat!\nWater levels in Fall can change fast! You can see the Chilkat River water level for the last 7 days and a water level forecast for the next 3 days, thanks to the National Weather Service. River fishing improves when the water level is stable and low.\nSockeye salmon\nThe sockeye salmon run through the Chilkoot River weir is winding down, but there are still a few fish in the river and lake. This year's escapement is approaching 65,000 fish.\nYou can learn a technique for sockeye sport fishing in glacial water starting at 2:45 in this ADF&G video.\nSockeye salmon counts through the Chilkat Lake weir are above average this year. Counts are projected to land near the upper end of the escapement goal range.\nPink salmon\nPink salmon are below average in the Chilkoot and the Chilkat rivers. But anglers still report good catch rates. They are aggressive biters and fun to catch.\nChar and Trout\nFish for Dolly Varden and Cutthroat Trout in clear water streams and lakes. Chilkat Lake and Mosquito Lake have special regulations to protect cutthroat trout:\n\nBait is not allowed.\nCutthroat and rainbow trout: 2 fish bag and possession limit, with a slot limit of 14-inch minimum to the 22-inch maximum length required to keep a fish.\n\nIn the remainder of the Haines and Skagway area fresh and salt waters, bait is allowed, and the regional length limit for cutthroat and rainbow trout is 11-minimum to the 22-inch maximum.\nFishing for Dolly Varden on Chilkoot Lake is good near the mouths of tributary streams. Chilkoot Lake and Chilkoot River have a special Dolly Varden bag limit:\n\nDolly Varden: 4 fish bags and possession limit, no size limit.\n\nIn the remainder of Haines-Skagway area salt and fresh waters and most of Southeast Alaska, the Dolly Varden bag and possession limit is 10 fish.\nSalt Water fishing opportunities\nShellfish\nPot fishing for shrimp and Dungeness crab is open year-round in the Haines and Skagway area saltwater.\n\nNon-Alaska residents with a sport fishing license catch shellfish with these bag & possession limits:\r\n\r\n\t\nDungeness crab - 3 legal size males.\nShrimp - 3 quarts or pounds.\n\n\nAlaska residents catch shellfish under subsistence or personal use regulations with more liberal bag & possession limits. See the Southeast Alaska Shellfish Regulation Summary booklet for details.\n\nAll shrimp harvesters must print a no-cost permit from the ADF&G online store and record their daily pot fishing effort and harvest on the paper permit. The harvest information must be reported online, or the paper permit must be returned to ADF&G by December 31, 2024.\nHalibut\nThere are still halibut in upper Lynn Canal. Catch rates typically decline at the end of the pink salmon runs.\nRockfish\nWhen the water is calm, take a trip south of town to catch rockfish.\nAll vessels sport fishing in Southeast Alaska saltwater is required to have at least one functional deepwater release device on board, regardless of the species targeted. Anglers are required to use a deepwater release device to release rockfish to the depth it was hooked or to at least 100 feet depth. To see examples of rockfish release devices and how they work, see the Southeast Alaska Sport Fish Regulation Summary, visit the Rockfish Conservation web page, or visit the Haines ADF&G office.\nRockfish regulations vary by species category. A handy rockfish ID guide is available to download or pick up a hard copy at the Haines Fish & Game office.\nDemersal Shelf Rockfish\n\nAlaska Residents: One demersal slope rockfish per day; two in possession.\nNon residents may not retain slope rockfish\nDemersal shelf rockfish species are yelloweye, quillback, china, tiger, canary, copper, and rosethorn rockfish.\n\nSlope Rockfish\n\nOne slope rockfish per day; one in possession.\nSome common slope rockfish species are redbanded, rougheye, silvergrey, shortraker, and vermilion rockfish.\n\nPelagic Rockfish\n\nFive pelagic rockfish per day; ten in possession.\nSome common pelagic rockfish species are black, dark, dusky, widow, and yellowtail rockfish.\n\nKing Salmon - No Retention Allowed in the Haines/Skagway Area\nADF&G is continuing king salmon conservation regulations to rebuild the Chilkat River king salmon from very low escapements. Restrictions on sport, commercial, and subsistence fisheries have been successful in delivering healthy king salmon escapements to Chilkat River spawning grounds.\n\nNow through December 31 - In the entire Haines and Skagway area, the retention of king salmon is prohibited; any king salmon caught must be released immediately and returned to the water unharmed\n\nSport Fishing Licenses\nAlaska residents under 18 years old do not need a sport fishing license. Non-Alaska residents under 16 years old do not need a sport fishing license.\nResidents of Yukon Territory in Canada may purchase an annual Alaska non-resident sport fishing license for the same price that Alaska residents pay. Yukoners are not Alaska residents, so Yukoners must comply with the non-resident regulations such as the number of shellfish pots, shellfish bag limits, and king salmon bag and annual limits. The Yukoner license is available from license vendors in Whitehorse, Haines, and Skagway.\nFor more information about sport fishing in Haines and Skagway, call Area Biologist Alex Tugaw at 907-766-3638."

While most of the early-season action was concentrated in the southern portion of the THA, the bite has now shifted north.\nAnglers are currently having the most success in areas like Lena Cove and the North Douglas/Fritz Cove area, which have become the latest hot spots. The south end of Gastineau Channel is still producing a few fish, but not at the pace seen earlier in the season.\nIn addition to kings, we’re starting to see a good number of coho showing up on the docks! Anglers are harvesting cohos from Pt. Retreat, North Shelter and Lincoln Islands, Funter Bay, and around Benjamin Island. Chums and pinks are also coming in, with most of them being caught in the same areas where coho are being found.\nOverall, the season is in full swing and fishing opportunities continue to be strong in the Juneau area.\nFishing Inside the THA\nThe Juneau area is fortunate to have a THA where both residents and nonresidents can continue to harvest king salmon within the designated boundaries. It is important to note that sport fishing for king salmon and all snagging is prohibited within a 300-yard radius of the Wayside Park Fishing Dock to protect salmon attempting to reach the fish ladder at the Macaulay Salmon Hatchery.\nBag & Possession Limits (Inside the THA):\n\nAll anglers bag and possession limit is four king salmon of any size;\nKing salmon harvested by nonresidents in the designated saltwater hatchery sport harvest area do not count toward their annual limit.\n\nMarine Waters Outside the Hatchery Area\n\nResident anglers bag and possession limit is one king salmon, 28 inches or greater in length;\nNonresident anglers king salmon may not be retained or possessed; any king salmon caught must be released immediately and returned to the water unharmed;\nAll anglers may not retain king salmon within the exclusive economic zone (3-200 nautical miles from shore).\n\nFor comprehensive details on specific areas, including maps, bag limits, and possession regulations, please refer to our latest  advisory announcements and emergency orders. Stay informed on the most current regulations and any recent changes.\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing is in full swing, and anglers are having solid success throughout the Juneau area. We’re now in the prime of the season, and more people are targeting halibut with good results.\nSome of the hottest spots continue to be North Shelter and Lincoln Island, along with Homeshore, Benjamin Island, and the waters around Hoonah/Icy Strait Point. While these areas are producing consistently, halibut are being caught in many other locations as well.\nIf you’ve been thinking about heading out, now’s a great time to go!\nIt's important to note that halibut fishing is federally managed. For detailed information on sport fishing regulations and guidelines for charter (guided) vs unguided halibut regulations in Southeast Alaska, please visit NOAA's website.\nSablefish (Black Cod)\nA few sablefish have been harvested recently near Point Howard, Couverden Rocks, and the Lynn Sisters. These deep-dwelling fish can be challenging to target, but for those willing to put in the effort, the reward is well worth it.\n\nResidents: 6 per day, 6 in possession, no size limit.\nNonresidents: 4 per day, 4 in possession, no size limit. There is a 8 fish annual limit, harvest record is required.\n\nRockfish\nDeepwater release devices are mandatory for all saltwater vessels. All vessels must have at least one functional deepwater release mechanism on board and readily available for use when sport fishing activities are taking place regardless of species targeted.\nAll rockfish not retained must be released at the depth they were caught or 100 feet, whichever is shallower.\nPlease visit our link to view deep water release device examples and tips and how these mechanisms are a helpful tool for conservation.\nAnglers are beginning to see more consistent rockfish catches around the Juneau area, coinciding with the recent uptick in halibut fishing. Duskies have made up the bulk of the reports so far, with a few Silvergray, Rougheye, Quillback, Redbanded, and Yelloweye rockfish also starting to show up on the docks. Most of these rockfish have been caught in the waters near North Shelter, Lincoln Island, Benjamin Island, and Point Retreat. As always, please follow current regulations and handle any released fish with care to help support the long-term health of these valuable stocks.\nPelagic Rockfish\n\nAll anglers: 3 per day, 6 in possession, no size limit.\nPelagic rockfish include, Black, Dark, Deacon, Dusky, Widow and Yellowtail rockfish.\n\nNonpelagic rockfish (demersal shelf & and slope rockfish)\n\n\nDemersal shelf rockfish (Yelloweye, Quillback, Tiger, China, Canary, Copper and Rosethorn rockfish)\n\nAlaska residents: 1 per day, 2 in possession, no size limit.\nNonresidents:\n\nSeason: July 1 – August 25;\n1 daily, 1 in possession, annual limit of ONE fish.\nImmediately upon landing and retaining a demersal shelf rockfish, a nonresident must enter the species, date and location on the back of their sport fishing license or on a nontransferable harvest record.\n\n\n\n\n\nSlope rockfish (Blackgill, Blackspotted, Blue, Bocaccio, Brown, Chilipepper, Darkblotched, Greenstriped, Harlequin, Northern, Pacific Ocean Perch, PugetSound, Pygmy, Redstripe, Redbanded, Rougheye, Sharpchin, Shortbelly, Shortraker, Silvergray, Splitnose, Stripetail, Vermilion, and Yellowmouth)\n\nAll anglers: 1 per day, 2 in possession, no size limit.\n\n\n\nNot all rockfish species found in Alaska are listed above. For a complete list of species you may encounter in Alaska, please visit our website.\nDolly Varden and cutthroat trout Fishing\nIn mid-summer, Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout have begun moving into local creeks to feast on salmon eggs. The best way to catch these fish is by using egg patterns or small spinners and spoons. Make sure to visit Go Fish AK and explore the interactive map to identify the species you're interested in fishing for.\nIn all drainages crossed by the Juneau road system, as well as the saltwater adjacent to the Juneau road system to a line 1/4 mile offshore, cutthroat and rainbow trout bag limits (in combination) are 2 daily, 2 in possession with a 14-inch minimum and 22-inch maximum size limit. Dolly Varden limits are 2 daily, 2 in possession, no size limit. Anglers should check the 2025 Southeast Alaska Sport Fish Regulation Summary or special regulations specific to the stream or lake they intend to fish.\nShellfish Harvesting\nKing Crab\nPersonal use red and blue king crab fishing opened on July 1st, exclusively for Alaskan residents. To participate, anglers must hold a valid sport fishing license along with a 2025/2026 Southeast Alaska Regional Personal Use King Crab Permit. These are available at the ADF&G online store. Please check for Personal Use Emergency Orders, legal-size and pot configurations, and restrictions online. Section 11-A is currently CLOSED to Alaskan resident PU king crab fishing. Stay tuned for the Juneau area PU announcement later this year using the link above. Harvest must be reported online. Please check the 2025 Southeast Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary booklet pages 34-37 for regulations specific to shellfish.\nDungeness and Tanner Crab\nFor Alaskan residents in the Juneau area, licensed anglers may retain up to 20 male Dungeness crabs, with a minimum width of 6 1/2 inches and 30 male Tanner crabs, with a minimum width of 5 1/2 inches. While taking Dungeness crab, 5 pots or 10 rings per person may be used, with a max of 10 pots or 20 rings per vessel. While taking Tanner crab, no more than 4 pots or 10 rings per vessel may be used. In total, no more than 5 pots per person and 10 pots per vessel may be used for taking shellfish regardless of pot type.\nFor nonresidents in the Juneau area, licensed anglers can keep 3 male Tanner and Dungeness crab (in combination). Tanner males need to be 5 1/2 inch minimum width and Dungeness males need to be 6 1/2 inch minimum width.\nShrimp\nSport and personal use shrimp fisheries in the Juneau and Tenakee area will remain CLOSED until further notice. The closed area consists of all marine waters of Section 11-A north and west of a line extending from a regulatory marker near point Bishop to the Coast Guard marker and light on Point Arden, extending to a line at the latitude of Little Island light, and east of a line from Little Island light to Point Retreat light. And the Tenakee closed area consists of all marine waters in Tenakee Inlet west of the longitude of Corner Point at 135° 06.50' W long. Check the Sport and Personal Use Advisory Announcement,\nOutside the Juneau 11-A and Tenakee Inlet areas, sport and personal use shrimp fishing remains open. Sport and personal use shrimpers who have a valid sport fishing license must also have a free shrimp permit available on the ADF&G online store. Participating anglers must sign their permit in ink to make it valid and have the permit in possession while taking shrimp in Southeast Alaska. Shrimp limits and gear requirements for sport and personal use shrimp fishing cab be found on pages 34-37 of the 2025 Southeast Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary. Reporting of effort and harvest is required and must be submitted to the department even if you did not fish.\nClams\nADF&G does not recommend harvesting clams from any waters in the Juneau area due to the possibility that the clams may contain Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) toxins. Currently, no beaches in the Juneau area are monitored on a regular basis (i.e- \"certified\") for PSP toxins. If you harvest, you do so at your own risk of PSP poisoning. Sporadic sampling has been conducted by the Southeast Alaska Tribal Ocean Research (SEATOR) project, but clams of any species and at any time during the year may still contain toxic levels of PSP. Please navigate to the following Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) web page for more information about PSP.\nInteractive Fishing Location Maps\nCheck out the wefishak page on the ADF&G website for the new Juneau-Glacier Bay Interactive Map to discover popular fishing locations and information on species run timing, fishing gear selections, and boat and angler access tips through the Sport Fish gofishak application."

This will impact all waters in the Ketchikan Management Area except for the Herring Bay Terminal Harvest Area, which will remain open through July 31. The regional closure is necessary to keep the sport fishery within the 2025 sport allocation.\nKing salmon fishing has been strong, with the latter half of June and early July typically considered the peak period. Productive king salmon fishing areas around Ketchikan include the backside of Gravina Island, Clover Pass, and Herring Bay.\nA few summer coho are starting to show up, and catch rates are expected to improve as we move through July.\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing has picked up throughout June and is expected to remain strong throughout July. As the summer progresses, halibut will continue moving into shallower waters, improving access for anglers. Productive areas include Duke Island, Gravina Island/Vallenar Point, and Cape Chacon.\nLingcod\nLingcod fishing has been good.\n\nResidents: one fish per day; two in possession; no size limit.\nNonresidents: one fish per day, one in possession, size limit 30 – 35 inches in length or 55 inches or greater in length. Annual limit of two fish, one of which is 30 to 35 inches in length, one of which is 55 inches or greater in length, a harvest record is required.\n\nRockfish\nRockfish can be caught year-round.

Immediately upon landing and retaining a demersal shelf rockfish, a nonresident must enter the species, date and location on the back of their sport fishing license or on a nontransferable harvest record.\n\nPelagic Rockfish\nPelagic rockfish species include black, dark, dusky, widow, and yellowtail.\n\nAll anglers: three per day; six in possession.\n\nTrout and Dolly Varden\nTrout and Dolly Varden fishing is good in rivers and lakes throughout July. It is often an overlooked fishery while anglers target salmon. With lighter tackle and abundant fish, anglers often find success. When fishing lakes, concentrate your efforts near the inlet and outlet, where fish tend to congregate. Early July is a good time to target these fish before pink salmon begin moving into freshwater.\n\nADF&G creel technicians are on the docks interviewing anglers, participation is important and only takes a couple of minutes. During an interview, creel samplers will ask a few short questions about your fishing trip and collect biological data from the fish harvested. The data collected through this program is essential for the sustainable management of sport fisheries, guiding management decisions to ensure fishing and harvest opportunities are maintained for the future.\nAn excellent resource for planning a trip is the gofishak interactive map for Ketchikan which provides information on popular fishing locations, species run timing, fishing gear selections and boat and angler access."

    "full_text": "September through October Season\nCoho (silver) salmon fishing in the Chilkat River and Chilkoot River\nCoho fishing in the Chilkat and Chilkoot Rivers starts in late September when the glaciers stop melting, the water becomes clear of glacial silt, and the river water levels drop. River flooding from heavy rains can negatively affect angler success. A graph of the Chilkat River water level for the last 7 days and forecast for the next 2 days can be seen here.\nThe Chilkat River coho salmon run averages 70,000 fish, and Chilkat River fish wheel catches through early October give us a good indicator of run strength. The Chilkoot River run is much smaller, and the main run enters the Chilkoot River after the weir is removed in early September.\nCreel surveys of Chilkat and Chilkoot River coho salmon anglers take place in October, and results will be posted on the fishing report page each Monday in October.\nWhen fishing in the Chilkat River drainage, the bag limit is 3 coho salmon per day and 6 coho salmon in possession. To be out of an angler’s possession, the fish must be consumed or preserved in a way that they could be eaten after 15 days or more. Fish on ice in a cooler remain in the angler’s possession.\nWhen fishing in the Chilkoot River drainage, the bag and possession limit are both 2 coho salmon. Be advised that anglers are restricted by the regulations for the waters they are fishing in, and bag limits are not cumulative between areas. For example, an angler who caught 3 coho salmon on the Chilkat River one day would not be allowed to keep any coho salmon that same day on the Chilkoot River, as they would already have exceeded the Chilkoot daily limit.\nAfter feeding for the summer in near-shore salt waters, Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout return to the larger rivers, such as the Chilkat, Chilkoot, and Taiya Rivers, before finding lakes and deep fresh waters for the winter. Please refer to Sport Fishing Regulations link to the left for specifics on when bait use is allowed and the cutthroat size limits for specific waters.\nSport fishing for shrimp is open in the Haines and Skagway area. Non-Alaska resident anglers should read the regulation summary booklet for the bag & possession limits, and all shrimpers should review the pot configuration details in the regulation book.\nThe Southeast Alaska red and blue king crab personal use fishery is open July 1-March 31 to Alaska residents only, with a bag and possession limit of 1 legal size male crab. For the most current information on this closure, please refer to the ADF&G Commercial Fish Division’s king crab personal use news release.\nSteelhead are rare in the Haines and Skagway Area. If you happen to catch one, remember that steelhead must be at least 36 inches in length to be harvested. There is a 1 fish daily bag limit and 2 fish annual harvest limit per angler. Steelhead anglers must record their harvest on the back of their license.\nYukon Resident Sport Fishing Fees: Residents of Yukon, Canada may purchase a Class 11, Yukon annual sport fishing license and king salmon stamp for the same cost that Alaska residents pay. Yukon residents are considered non-Alaska residents and they must comply with all regulations pertaining to non-residents.

    "full_text": "October through March Season\nWinter Fishing\nAs winter time sets in around Juneau, most anglers take a few months off and prepare for the upcoming spring and summer season. However, some angling opportunities still exist during the winter months. Any pond or lake that will normally hold trout and salmon in the summer months should contain some “over-wintering” trout and Dolly Varden. The water will need to be deep enough to flow below the ice surface and provide enough room for fish to feed and swim throughout the winter. Ice fishing is typically done with light tackle and with the use of an “auger” to open a hole in the ice. Remember, most lakes in the Juneau area are off limits to the use of bait so be sure to check the regulations after selecting a place to fish. It’s always a good idea to check the local weather conditions and ice thickness before heading onto the ice. Be safe and have fun.\nTwin Lakes\n\nThe use of bait is allowed year-round\nStocked juvenile salmon (Chum, coho, king, pink, and sockeye) limits (in combination): 10 daily, 10 in possession, 16 inches or less\nCutthroat and rainbow trout limits (in combination): 5 daily, 5 in possession, no size limit\n\nSalmon Creek Reservoir\n\nThe use of bait is allowed year-round\nBrook trout: no size limit - 10 daily, 10 in possession\n\nDredge Lakes Area/Mendenhall Ponds (Morraine and Glacier lakes)\n\nBait prohibited, only unbaited artificial lures or flies may be used year-round\nDolly Varden: no size restrictions - 2 daily, 2 in possession\nCutthroat and rainbow trout limits (in combination): 2 daily, 2 in possession, 14 inch minimum and 22 inch maximum size limit\nRemainder of lakes in the Dredge Lakes Area (ie. Crystal, Dredge, Moose, etc…) have same bag and possession limit above but bait is allowed Sept. 15 - Nov. 15\n\nPeterson Creek Salt Chuck\n\nBait prohibited, only unbaited artificial lures or flies may be used year-round\nDolly Varden: no size restrictions - 2 daily, 2 in possession\nCutthroat and rainbow trout limits (in combination): 2 daily, 2 in possession, 14 inch minimum and 22 in maximum size limit\n\nWindfall Lake\n\nBait prohibited, only unbaited artificial lures or flies may be used year-round\nDolly Varden: no size restrictions - 2 daily, 2 in possession\nCutthroat and rainbow trout limits (in combination): 2 daily, 2 in possession, 14 inch minimum and 22 inch maximum size limit\n\nPeterson Lake\n\nDolly Varden: no size restrictions - 2 daily, 2 in possession\nCutthroat and rainbow trout limits (in combination): 2 daily, 2 in possession, 14 inch minimum and 22 in maximum size limit\n\nIn addition to freshwater ice fishing, anglers can target king salmon while trolling the salt waters near Juneau. King salmon are present in local marine waters throughout the year. The following regulations apply for the 2015/2016 winter season:\nWinter king salmon trolling (saltwater)\n\nPlease check the current year's News Release to get the bag and possession limits for winter king salmon fishing"

    "title": "Apr - May",
    "date": "Apr - May",
    "full_text": "April through May Season\nSpring fishing opportunities in the Juneau area include; king salmon, Dolly Varden, cutthroat trout, steelhead, and halibut. King salmon can be found in the saltwater areas near False Outer Point, Auke Bay, Tee Harbor, the Breadline, and Point Bishop. These areas have been known to provide the best chance to catch an early season king salmon. During this time, Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout begin to congregate at the mouths of local creeks such as Salmon Creek, Sheep Creek, and Cowee Creek to feed on emigrating salmon smolts.   Using small smolt imitation fly patterns or small spinners is the best way to catch these aggressive fish.  Steelhead can also be pursued during this time as they begin their return to natal streams to spawn. Peterson Creek and Cowee Creek are the two most popular spots to try to catch a steelhead on the Juneau road system. During this time halibut begin to move into the interior waters surrounding Juneau as catch rates slowly increase with the onset of summer.\nKing Salmon fishing\nSpring king season is in full swing by May and offers saltwater enthusiasts the chance to land a real lunker! Please check the current year's News Release for up to date regulations including current bag and possession limits. Non-resident anglers will be subject to an annual limit, and most areas require a minimum size limit of 28” for king salmon. In Southeast, almost all kings are harvested in saltwater and are incredible table fare. You can fish from shore at one of the many popular shoreside “points” around Juneau, or head out in the boat. Shoreside anglers begin fishing the Picnic Cove and Tee Harbor shorelines in March, but catch rates usually don't pick up until about mid April. Shoreline fishing should continue to be good until the end of May. Casting with large spoons or small herring seem to be the most successful shoreside methods. If you are fishing from a boat, there is no shortage of specialized king salmon gear, so find your favorite flasher, spoon or herring rig and try your luck at trolling to entice these prized fish to bite. ADF&G Marine Creel personnel begin their surveys of shoreside fishing areas in mid to late March.  Please help them collect the requested information so that ADF&G can continue to sustainably manage king salmon stocks.\nSteelhead Trout fishing\nTypically steelhead anglers aim to intercept the fish as they enter into streams from the salt water in late April though May. Often, entire days can be spent searching for a few quality “looks” at a fish, so don’t be discouraged if it takes time, because the fight in a fresh steelhead will make it all worth while. Most streams that contain steelhead in southeast have small annual returns (in the hundreds) and thus can be vulnerable to over-fishing. Retention of steelhead in the Juneau area is prohibitied. Any steelhead caught in a drainage crossed by the Juneau road system must be released immediately.  Current regionwide regulations elsewhere prohibit any steelhead under 36” from being harvested and require that a harvest record be completed in ink immediately upon landing a steelhead that is to be harvested. There are a number of streams on the Juneau road system that contain small runs of steelhead that are easily fishable. Keep in mind that all fish should be treated with great care regardless of size to ensure the best chances for survival upon release.\nOther trout/Dolly Varden fishing\nSpring is the time when sea run Dolly Varden and other trout begin eating more and preparing for the summer in area salt waters. During the spring, some of these fish will exit their “over wintering” sites (lakes and ponds) and head downstream for the ocean. These fish are known as “anadromous” fish. Lake outlets and streams that connect to the salt water are prime places to harvest these fish in the spring. After the outmigration, the saltwater shoreline fishing can be very productive as Dollys and other trout begin to spend most of their time looking for food by cruising the rocky coves and bays. Spoons and spinners work well, as do smolt and fry imitation flies. There will also be some fish that do not exit their “over wintering” sites and head for the ocean. Known as “residents”, these fish stay in their home lake, pond, or corresponding stream the entire year. While these fish may move around in the system to take advantage of food or environmental conditions, they will be present for your fishing pleasure all year."

    "title": "Aug - Sep",
    "date": "Aug - Sep",
    "full_text": "August through September Season\nLate summer brings excellent freshwater trout fishing as Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout begin to feed on salmon eggs. Any stream that has runs of pink and chum salmon will also have aggressive trout. Using egg patterns or small spinners is the best way to catch these feeding trout. During late summer and early fall coho salmon begin to show up in local watersheds. These silver salmon are found in large numbers in Gastineau Channel as they return to DIPAC hatchery, accessible from various turnouts along Egan Drive and Douglas highway, and at Sheep Creek near Thane. Cohos can be intercepted as they return to Montana Creek, Cowee Creek, and Peterson Creek to spawn. Targeting cohos with large fly patterns or spinners is effective. Silver salmon fishing can be good into November, but typically peaks near the end of September. Saltwater fishing for cohos in August in area marine waters can also be quite productive, with fewer pinks around to steal your bait. Fishing for halibut is also decent during August and early September as these fish stay in the interior waters near Juneau to feed on salmon carcasses.\nSalmon fishing\nSaltwater\nChum(dog), and pink (humpies) salmon arrive in Juneau area marine waters during July, but usually have peaked by early August, except during odd years when higher pink salmon abundance may extend the season. Coho (silver) salmon fishing is great during August and September with peak marine catch rates occurring by about mid August and freshwater catch rates peaking mid-September into October. Some popular marine angling spots for coho salmon are the Breadline, North and South Shelter Island, Pt. Retreat, and the western shoreline of Admirlaty island. Cohos bound for Canada up the Taku River can also be caught at Pt. Salisbury, Pt. Bishop, and the backside of Douglas Island. These aggresive, hard-fighting salmon make great table fare and are also fun to catch in marine waters and in their natal streams.\nFreshwater and Saltwater Shoreline Fishing\nMany anglers consider August and September to be the best time for freshwater fishing in the Juneau area. Pink and chum salmon fishing can still be quite good during the first couple weeks of August. Some good fishing spots for pink and chum salmon include Cowee Creek, Echo Cove, Amalga Harbor, and Macauley Hatchery. Anglers in pursuit of coho salmon will find good fishing at Montana Creek, Lena Pt., Cowee Creek, Peterson Creek, Amalga Harbor, Macauley Hatchery, and at the new release site at the mouth Sheep Creek below the bridge. Remember that the bag limit for coho salmon in Juneau freshwater systems is 2 fish per day, 2 in possession. Six coho salmon can be kept daily with 12 in possession from saltwater, which is defined as those waters below mean low tide. Anglers are reminded to check the Sport Fishing Regulations summary booklet or contact the Juneau area office if they have any questions about regulations.\nTrout and Char fishing\nDuring late summer and fall, sea run Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout continue to follow the salmon into freshwater stream systems. These egg predators also feed on decaying salmon flesh, which provides additional nutrients to freshwaters and riparian zones stimulating periphyton and insect production. Salmon carcasses bring marine derived nutrients to stream systems that feed a variety of fish, birds, mammals and streamside vegetation for many months. Anglers can be succesful with egg patterns, beads, egg-sucking leaches, flesh imitation flies, small spinners and small spoons. Bag and possession limits for cutthroat trout are more restrictive and size restrictions apply. The regionwide regulations for cutthroat are 2 per day, 2 in possession, with a 14 inch minimum and 22 inch maximum length. Don’t assume that the water you are fishing falls under the regionwide regulations until you have checked to see if there are specific exceptions for that spot. Some popular fishing spots for Dollys and cutthroat trout include Montana Creek, Peterson Creek, Cowee Creek, Gastineau Channel, Auke Lake, and Windfall Creek (closed June and July) and lake.\nCrab and Shrimp\nSport and Personal Use shrimp and king crab fishing is still closed in area waters closest to Juneau (11-A) due to low abundance, but Dungeoness and Tanner crabbing can be quite good in the Juneau Area during late summer and early fall. During this period these species are actively feeding on salmon carcasses washed out of the estuaries.  For Tanner crab, August and September are also historically the months with the lowest levels of bitter tasting meat caused Bitter Crab Syndrome. Please check the Sport Fishing Regulations Summary Booklet, or call the Juneau area Fish and Game office to determine which sport and personal use regulations apply, how many pots are allowed and how they should be configured, how to identify male crab, what sizes are legal, and what the daily bag and possession limits are for each species."

    "area": "Juneau",
    "title": "Jun - Jul",
    "date": "Jun - Jul",
    "full_text": "June through July Season\nSummer brings an increase in fishing opportunities as salmon begin to migrate into local watersheds on their way to natal spawning grounds or hatchery release sites. During this time large numbers of king salmon, pink salmon, and chum salmon can be found throughout the Juneau area. Saltwater king salmon fishing opportunities include; Auke Bay, Fritz Cove Road, North Douglas, and Gastineau Channel. These areas host good catch rates as large numbers of hatchery king salmon move through the area on their return to hatchery release sites at DIPAC, Fish Creek pond, and the mouth of Auke Creek. These king salmon may be targeted in all saltwater areas and freshwater drainages along the Juneau road system icnluding Fish Creek and Fish Creek pond. Sockeye salmon can be found at Windfall Creek where sport fishing is prohibited from June 1st – July 31st, except for Wednesdays and Saturdays during the month of June. Pink and chum salmon can be found in large numbers near the mouths of freshwater streams as they begin their spawning migration. Pink salmon are notoriously aggressive and make up the largest runs of any species of Pacific salmon. During this time, Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout can be found in Cowee Creek, Montana Creek and Sheep Creek as they move upstream to coincide with the arrival of the salmon. Halibut fishing begins to pick up during this time and halibut can be found in Icy Straits, North Pass, Halibut Cove, and the reefs north of Shelter Island.\nSalmon fishing\nSaltwater\nCoho (silver), chum (dog), and pink (humpies) salmon arrive in Juneau area marine waters during June and July. Marine harvest rates for chum and pink salmon peak around the end of July to the first of August. Coho salmon fishing is generally excellent later in the year but cohos will start to show up in the marine fisheries in mid-summer. King salmon are also present in good numbers near the hatchery release sites. Some popular marine angling spots are the Breadline, Pt. Salisbury, Pt. Bishop, the backside of Douglas Island, North and South Shelter Island, and Pt. Retreat.\nAnglers usually harvest salmon in marine waters by trolling or mooching herring, hoochies, flies, or plugs. Trolling involves actively pulling terminal fishing gear through the water fast enough to provide a spin or roll which imitates a wounded baitfish. Mooching is done from an anchored or drifting boat and is an effective technique when fishing in medium to strong currents. This type of fishing involves jigging or mooching gear that allows the gear to flutter and drift with the current.\nFreshwater and Saltwater Shoreline Fishing\nMany anglers consider late July through September to be the best time to fish freshwater streams in the Juneau area. Pink and chum salmon fishing is excellent during the last few weeks of July and first couple weeks of August. Some good fishing spots for pink and chum salmon include Cowee Creek, Echo Cove, Amalga Harbor, and Macauley Hatchery. Freshwater anglers have success with spinners, spoons, and flies. Hardware anglers typically use bright colors, but can also have good luck with silver or black. Fly anglers will have good luck with red, orange, black, or green colored streamers, egg sucking leaches, and egg patterns. Try a variety of retrieves from “dead” drifting along the bottom to quick strips of the line across the upper part of the water column. Following Board of Fisheries action taken during January of 2015, freshwater drainages crossed by the Juneau Road System that are open to sport fishing were opened year-round to king salmon fishing with a bag and possession limit of 4 fish of any size. King salmon caught by nonresidents in these drainages do not count toward their annual limit. In addition, liberlized methods and means went into effect for Fish Creek Pond from June 1- August 31. Please consult the Southeast Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary Booklet for these regulations.\nAlthough saltwater shoreline catch rates for king salmon have generally ended by the first week of June, good catches of hatchery king salmon in good condition can often be had at the mouth of Fish Creek on Douglas and along the shoreline at DIPAC from mid to late June. Casting with large spoons or sinners or mooching with plugs will often entice a strike. Snagging is prohibited in saltwater at the mouth of Auke Creek, at the mouth of Fish Creek, at the mouth of Peterson Creek, and off the Gastineau Channel Wayside Park fishing dock.\nTrout and Char fishing\nDuring the summer months, sea run Dolly Varden follow salmon from marine waters into freshwater systems. “Dollys” are often associated with spawning salmon and can be seen feeding on salmon eggs. Anglers are successful with egg imitation patterns like beads or egg sucking leaches. Dolly Varden also actively feed on salmon carcasses and are often taken with flesh imitation flies. Anglers using spinning tackle can have success with small spinners, pixies and other spoons.\nSea run cutthroat trout can be found near stream mouths and along area shorelines. The abundance of sea run cutthroat trout is low compared to sea run Dolly Varden, so bag and possession limits are more restrictive and size restrictions apply. The regulations for cutthroat are 2 per day, 2 in possession, with a 14 inch minimum and 22 inch maximum length. Please check the regulation summary booklet for the watershed you are fishing for trout regulations.  Similar techniques used for harvesting Dolly’s can be effective while fishing for sea-run cutthroat. Some popular fishing spots for Dollys and cutthroat trout include Montana Creek, Peterson Creek (including the saltchuck), Cowee Creek, Gastineau Channel, Auke Lake, and Windfall Creek (closed June and July) and Windfall Lake.\nSome freshwater opportunities exist for trout and char that are partially or completely isolated from marine waters. On the Juneau road system, these systems include Peterson Creek (above the falls) and lake, Cropley Lake, Salmon Creek Reservoir (brook trout), Dredge Lakes, and Fish Creek above Eaglecrest Road. Dolly Varden and trout caught in these systems are generally small (6” – 10”) and are mostly considered to be resident fish.\nCrab and Shrimp\nFishing for Dungeoness and Tanner crab is open in the the immediate Juneau area. King crab and shrimp fishing in the area closest to Juneau (Section 11-A) are currently closed due to low abundance. Opportunites to fish for these species exist outside the immediate Juneau area but there are limited bag and possession limits.  Anglers should check with the Juneau area Fish and Game office to determine which sport and personal use regulations apply before setting pots."

For current seasonal information, please contact the Anchorage office at (907) 267-2218.\nGeneral Area Description: includes all waters between Cape Fairfield and Cape Suckling.\nFreshwater Fishing\nSalmon\n\nCoho (silver) salmon fishing has been fair to good at Alaganik Slough (Cordova area) and coho are spread throughout the entire slough. Anglers have been having success at the lower boat launch (mile 16) on the Alaganik. On the lower river, fishing on the rising and falling tides can increase your success. Try soaking salmon roe on the bottom.\nEyak River (Cordova area) is producing a few coho salmon, but fishing has been slow. High and dirty water may impact success and anglers should expect to put in extra time to catch fish.\nCoho salmon has been fair to good at Ibeck Creek (Cordova area). Anglers are reporting catching limits when casting chartreuse or pink spinners or while soaking salmon roe on the bottom.\r\n\t\nReminder: The coho salmon bag limit for the Copper River Highway streams remains at 3 fish per day and in possession.\n\n\n\nCutthroat Trout/Dolly Varden\nDolly Varden are entering from many Prince William Sound streams in good numbers. Try fishing egg pattern near schools of spawning salmon.\nSaltwater Fishing\nHalibut\n\nHalibut are still available throughout Prince William Sound, but fishing is slowing down. Try fishing at the entrances of a bay at depths of 150-300’ with a jig tipped with herring.\nHalibut fishing has been fair to good in the outside waters of Prince William Sound when weather has allowed. Anglers are reporting catches of mostly small halibut and catch rates have started to decrease. Anglers have been successful by setting a chum bag and fishing a large herring on a circle hook.\n\nLingcod\nAnglers continue to catch legal-sized lingcod late into the season by jigging over rocky pinnacles in the outside water of Prince William Sound.\nRockfish\nFishing has been good for pelagic rockfish near the entrances to Prince William Sound.\nSalmon\n\nOverall, fishing for coho salmon has been very slow in Prince William Sound from a boat. Anglers are having mixed success near Esther Island, Pigot Point, and Passage Canal. If you are fishing from a boat expect to put in extra effort.\r\n\t\nAttention: Effective Saturday August 24, the possession limit for salmon, other than king salmon, is 6 fish per day and 12 fish in possession, of which only 1 per day and in possession may be a coho salmon in Prince William Sound excluding the Whittier, Cordova, Valdez, and Chenega Terminal Harvest Areas.\n\n\nCoho salmon are arriving at Fleming Spit (Cordova area) in small numbers and schools have been observed on the incoming tides.\nCoho salmon have been reported in Passage Canal including at the head of the bay and near Cove Creek. Fishing has been spotty, but anglers are having success casting large spoons.\nFishing for coho salmon from shore at Allison Point and near the harbor in Valdez has been slow to fair.\r\n\t\nAttention: Effective Friday, September 13, the Valdez Terminal Harvest Area, including Allison Point and the Valdez Boat Harbor, is closed to the retention of coho salmon.\n\n\n\nLocal Lakes\nBlueberry and Thompson have been great for lake fishing. Fishing for rainbow trout in both lakes has been good to excellent. Anglers may also find lake trout in Blueberry and Arctic grayling in Thompson. These lakes can produce very good in the fall.\nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nNEW: Emergency Order 2-SS-6-62-24 restricts the retention of coho salmon in the Valdez vicinity - Terminal Harvest Area through October 31, 2024.\nEmergency Order 2-SS-6-60-24 reduces the bag and possession limit for salmon, other than king salmon, to 6 fish per day, of which only 1 fish per day and 1 in possession may be a coho salmon in the waters of Prince William Sound excluding the Whittier, Cordova, Valdez, and Chenega Terminal Harvest Areas.\nEmergency Order 2-SS-6-52-24 reduces the bag and possession limit for salmon, other than king salmon, to six fish per day and 12 fish in possession, of which only three per day, and 6 in possession may be a coho salmon in the Valdez vicinity - Terminal Harvest Area.\nEmergency Order 2-RS-6-35-24 increases the sockeye salmon bag and possession limit to 12 fish per day, 24 in possession in the Coghill River drainage. Additionally, this emergency order reduces the area closed to fishing adjacent to the Coghill River weir to 50 feet.\nEmergency Order 2-SHR-6-03-24 reduced the number of shrimp pots allowed to harvest shrimp in the Prince William Sound noncommercial shrimp fishery. The pot limit per person and per vessel has been reduced to three pots; however, of those three pots only two pots can be set in areas of historical high effort including areas near the Port of Valdez, near the Port of Whittier, and in portions of Port Wells and Culross Passage.\nEmergency Order 2-RF-6-04-24 reduces the rockfish bag and possession limits in Prince William Sound to three per day and six in possession of which only one per day, one in possession can be nonpelagic.

Numbers at the Coghill River weir continue to improve and conditions are good for fishing. Daily sockeye salmon passage counts are available online.\nSockeye salmon are present throughout the Eyak River and just below the lake.

Try fishing large circle hooks with herring or salmon bellies while anchored up with a chum bag.\nHalibut has been good inside Prince William Sound as halibut are well spread out. Try fishing depths of 200-300 ft on the outer edges of Perry and Naked Islands and the entrance of bays.\n\nLingcod\nLingcod fishing has been decent around rocky pinnacles near Elrington Island, Johnstone Bays, and Hinchinbrook Entrance. Try drifting over rocky structure with a white twister tail on a large jig tipped with herring.\nRockfish\n\nLarge schools of pelagic rockfish can typically be found near the entrances and the coastal outside waters and fishing can be hot.

Fishing will continue to build as more fish stack up near the hatchery in Valdez. Try casting spinners and spoons from Allison Point. Fishing will be hit and miss for pinks from shore as the commercial fishery will be active harvesting on a large return of pink salmon this year.\nAnglers trolling for salmon are still picking up king salmon and starting to catch coho salmon around Cape Cleare, Crafton, Glacier and Naked Islands, and Passage Canal. Coho fishing will continue to improve over the coming weeks.\n\nLocal lakes\nThompson Lake, Blueberry Lake, and Ruth Pond have all been stocked recently!

Finding clear water will improve catch rates.\nDolly Varden can be caught in the streams and off the beach by fishing small spinners and spoons or fly fishing with smolt patterns.\n\nSaltwater Fishing\nHalibut\n\nHalibut fishing has been good to excellent for anglers traveling outside of Resurrection Bay. Anglers have been returning with limits of halibut and the occasional halibut over 100-pounds. Fishing a large herring or a salmon belly on a circle hook while chumming has been the best method for halibut.\nHalibut are being caught in good numbers inside Resurrection Bay. Anglers have had success drifting jigs tipped with herring near drop-offs and kelp beds near the outer portions of Resurrection Bay.\n\nLingcod\nLingcod season opened on July 1. Anglers have been catching many good-sized lingcod. Fishing medium twister-tail jigs tipped with herring is an effective way to target lingcod.\nRockfish\nRockfish catches have been excellent near the entrance of Resurrection Bay and along the Gulf Coast. Anglers are having no trouble filling their limit of pelagic rockfish.\nOther Finfish\nPacific (gray) cod and pollock have been plentiful this year and fishing has been excellent inside Resurrection Bay. Try fishing with jigs or a small chunk of herring right off the bottom near the Sea Life Center, off Lowell Point, or the mouths of Lowell (waterfall) or Tonsina creeks.\nSalmon\n\nKing salmon fishing has been fair to good inside Resurrection Bay. Anglers are picking up king salmon throughout Resurrection Bay while trolling and jigging for other species.\nCoho (silver) salmon have started to show up in the outer portions of Resurrection Bay and in the outside waters of the North Gulf Coast. Fishing has picked up since last week but will be slow to start. Anglers should try fishing the Cheval or El Dorado Narrows and Pony Cove to find early coho (silver) salmon.\nFishing has been slow for the youth-only fishery in the Seward Lagoon. Some king salmon are present in the lagoon and anglers will need to work for their catch.\r\n\t\nReminder: The Seward Lagoon and outfall stream youth-only fishery for king salmon began on June 17 and will end on June 30. This fishery is open to anglers 15 years of age or younger. See page 73 of 2024 Southcentral Regulation Booklet.\n\n\nSockeye salmon fishing at the mouth of the Resurrection River and Spring Creek has slowed way down. Dedicated anglers are still finding the occasional fish or two, but limits are very unlikely. We are at the tail end of the sockeye run in Resurrection Bay.\n\nLocal Lakes\nFirst Lake was stocked with rainbow trout early in the summer and trout are still available in First Lake. Fishing has been slow as fish have been picked out over the last few weeks, but it could be a great place to try with the kids if you are in Seward for Fourth of July. Try casting small spinners or fishing bait under a bobber.\nSpecial species information\nNew in regulation as of 2024: the rockfish bag and possession limits in North Gulf Coast/Resurrection Bay has been changed to three per day and six in possession of which only one per day, two in possession can be nonpelagic.\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nNEW: Emergency Order 2-KS-8-29-24 extends the youth-only king salmon fishery in the Seward Lagoon and outfall stream through July 31st, 2024.\nEmergency Order 2-RS-8-23-24: increases the bag and possession limit for sockeye salmon from three to 12 in the fresh waters downstream from the Seward Highway and downstream from Nash Road to the saltwater markers and six to 12 in the salt waters of Resurrection Bay north of a point from Caines Head to the northern point of Thumb Cove.\n\nDon't forget to purchase your 2024 sport fishing license and king stamp!

All fresh waters between Gore Point and Cape Fairfield.\nFreshwater Fishing\nSalmon\n\nFreshwaters in Resurrection Bay downstream of the Seward Highway and Nash Road is open to salmon fishing. Fishing has been very slow for sockeye salmon but a few straggling sockeye are still available. Try locating small pods of fish that may have come in on the high tides.\r\n\t\nReminder: Only unbaited, single hook lures or flies are allowed in this section, and snagging is not permitted. The bag and possession limits are 3 for salmon other than king salmon (in combination), of which, only 2 may be coho salmon.\n\n\n\nSaltwater Fishing\nHalibut\n\nHalibut fishing has been good when the weather has allowed boats to travel out. Anglers are reporting catches of large fish outside of Resurrection Bay. Outside of the bay target halibut on flats off the edge of points and pinnacles in about 200-300 feet of water while on anchor. Use large circle hooks with herring or salmon bellies.\nFishing inside the bay has been productive as well, but mostly small to medium-sized halibut. Fish with large jigs tipped with herring while anchored up with a chum bag. Locations to try include Bulldog Cove, Hat Island, Mary’s Bay, and the drop off near Tonsina Creek.\n\nLingcod\nAnglers reported fair to good success fishing around rocky structures in the Gulf of Alaska over the last week. Rocky pinnacles and capes are excellent locations to target lingcod. Try drifting over rocky structure with a white twister tail on a large jig tipped with herring.\nRockfish\n\nAnglers have reported good catch rates of a variety of pelagic rockfish near the entrance of Resurrection Bay and along the Gulf Coast.\r\n\t\nReminder: Effective May 27 through September 15, only 2 pelagic rockfish may be retained as part of a total bag limit of 3 rockfish.\n\n\n\nSalmon\n\nKing salmon fishing has been slow to fair in Resurrection Bay by boat with anglers having to put in extra time to catch fish. Try trolling small herring near Derby Cove and Caines Head to target king salmon in the bay.\nFishing from shore near the lagoon outflow has been slow for hatchery king salmon, but fish are continuing to return. Casting spoons or snagging as the tide rises from shore can be productive if you put in the effort.\nSockeye fishing has been very slow. Sockeye salmon can be caught at the head of the bay near Spring Creek or Resurrection River with a lot of effort, and anglers should not expect to catch limits.\nCoho salmon are getting picked up near Driftwood Bay and the outer portions of Resurrection Bay, including Pony Cove and Cheval Narrows. Some fish are even being caught further inside the bay as close as Caines Head. Locating a school of coho and mooching with a hoochie squid and a small chunk of herring is a good method to target these salmon.\nThe Seward Lagoon and outfall stream is currently open for a youth-only king salmon fishing opportunity. A few king salmon are still in the lagoon and fishing could improve with some late arrivals.\r\n\t\nBy emergency order, this youth fishery is extended through July 31.\nReminder: Only one hook (single or treble) may be used during the youth-only fishery, but bait is permitted.\n\n\n\nLocal lakes\n\nFishing at First Lake has been very slow as most of the rainbow trout that were stocked in early summer have been caught.\nFishing at Troop Lake has been excellent for rainbow trout and Arctic char. It is a short hike, but where the trail meets the lake, anglers can catch rainbow trout easily. A pack raft could be used to explore the lake and improve fish size and catch rates. Small spinners or nymph fly patterns are a great way to target these hungry fish.\n\nSpecial species information\nDolly Varden have started to show up around the beaches in Seward, such as Spring Creek and Lowell Point. Fishing will improve as other salmon species, such as pink salmon, begin showing up. Try casting medium-size spinners or small spoons off the beach.\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nEffective May 27, Emergency Order 2-RF-7-21-25 reduces rockfish bag and possession limits in the salt waters of North Gulf Coast area (including Resurrection Bay) to 3 per day and 6 in possession of which only 2 per day and 4 in possession may be a pelagic rockfish and only 1 per day and 2 in possession may be nonpelagic rockfish from May 27 – September 15. In addition, yelloweye rockfish may not be retained from May 27 through June 30, 2025.\nEffective July 1, Emergency Order 2-KS-8-27-25 extends the youth only king salmon fishery in Seward Lagoon and the outfall stream through July 31.\n\nDon't forget to purchase your 2025 sport fishing license and king stamp! You can purchase and display your fishing license and king stamp, record your annual harvest (i.e. king salmon), access sport fishing regulations and locations, and so much more on your mobile device.

It is early, but anglers could try Cottonwood Creek for sockeye. This is a weekend only fishery open Saturdays and Sundays from 5:00am-10:00pm. You can fish from the mouth upstream 1 mile.\nFish Creek off Knik Goose Bay is open seven days a week until July 14 from 5:00am-10:00pm.

Try Long Lake (mile 86), Ravine, Weiner, Bonnie and Knob Lakes.\nIf you are looking for big rainbows try fishing: Loon, Lucile, Finger, Matanuska, Seymour, and Anderson Lakes. Find the deep spots, the rainbows will avoid hot water when it gets this warm and are easier to target. See the Alaska Lake Database for lake maps.\nFor some diversity, give Matanuska or Long Lake (mile 86) a shot for lake trout fishing.\nIf you are up for a 4-wheel adventure, try fishing Wishbone (single-hook C&R lake), Ruby, or Goober Lakes.\n\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nEmergency Order 2-KS-2-05-24 Closes the Susitna River drainage to sport fishing for king salmon.

Any king salmon, including jacks incidentally hooked, must be immediately released and may not be removed from the waters, except for the stocked fishery at the Eklutna Tailrace where king salmon fishing is open year-round.\nSome chums and pinks are making their way up the Susitna. Try the mouth of Deshka for pinks and perhaps an early coho salmon.\nChum, sockeye, and a few pinks are beginning to show on the lower Little Su and generally the first coho is caught sometime this week.\nTry the weekend only fishery at the mouth of Cottonwood Creek for some bright sockeye salmon. It’s open to fishing 5 a.m.-10 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.\nFish Creek sockeye counts are posted on our webpage under Fish Counts. The sport fishery is closed by regulation July 15 (Monday) including weekends. Stay tuned in case the personal use fishery is opened by emergency order. The department must project more than 35,000 sockeye salmon prior to opening this dip net fishery. This fishery typically opens towards the end of July.\nThe Susitna personal use dipnet fishery is now open on the lower Susitna River. This fishery runs 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. on Wednesdays and Saturdays only from July 10 to July 31. The designated area for fishing is between regulatory markers posted approximately one mile downstream of Susitna Station (just below the Yentna River mouth) down to markers posted just below the Alexander Creek cut-off/northern tip of Bell Island.

An Upper Cook Inlet Personal Use permit is required in addition to a sport fishing license. Only Alaska residents may participate in this fishery. Upper Cook Inlet Personal Use permit harvest and participation must be reported online no later than August 31 through the ADF&G harvest reporting webpage.\n\n\n\nRainbow Trout, Arctic Grayling, and Dolly Varden\n\nFishing for rainbows on the Parks Highway streams is good. Try Willow, Montana, Kashwitna, Little Willow and Goose Creek. Fish wet flies like wooly buggers, leeches, sculpins and egg sucking leeches, soon beads will be the ticket. Grayling fishing has been good too. They like gold or yellow flies and lures, stick to small sizes. Try bead head nymphs, Elk Hair Caddis, Mayflies, or a good old stone fly.\nWillow Creek has multiple access points off Willow Fishhook Road.

If you are 15 years of age or younger, you may fish for all species, except king salmon. Bag limit is 3 salmon per day of which only 2 may be coho for the youth-only fishery. Fishing for anglers of all ages will open again at 5 a.m. on Monday August 5 from 5am-10pm through the remainder of the season.\nJim Creek closes Mondays and Tuesdays on August 1 and fishing is only allowed between 5am-10pm on Wednesdays through Sundays for the remainder of the season.\nCoho fishing is mostly slow on the lower Little Susitna River out of the Little Susitna Public Use Facility. With waters continuing to clear, fishing should improve for coho, pinks, and chums.\nPinks and chums are available along Parks Highway streams with coho catches being slow. By highway vehicle, try the mouths of Willow, Kashwitna, Caswell, Sheep, and Montana creeks. By boat, try the mouth of Little Willow.\nWater levels are good for coho fishing at the Deshka mouth and lower river up to the weir. This fishery has been performing poorly, but early morning or late evening fishing should increase your chances at catching coho. No shortage of pink salmon!\nTry the lower sloughs of the Yentna, such and Moose and Indian creeks, and also at Lake Creek. Coho fishing is also slow here, but this fishery is expected to pick up in these areas this weekend and into next week.\nFor sockeye, try Cottonwood (weekend only) and Jim Creek in the Knik Arm area and Larson Creek of the Talkeetna River.\nFish counts and water stage is posted on our Fish Count webpage. Jim Creek counts are now available online.\n\nRainbow Trout, Arctic Grayling, and Dolly Varden\n\nFishing is good on Parks Highway streams. Take advantage of the short summer, with the sun in the forecast and water levels forecasted to go down, conditions should clear up from the recent rain. This is a good time for egg patterns, egg sucking leaches, and flesh flies. Also try sculpins, leeches, mice, and dolly llamas. Olive and white are good color choices.\nDeception Creek, Byers, and Honolulu Creeks are a little more off the beaten path. You can also do a Railroad whistle stop off Indian Creek if you are feeling adventurous.\nAugust fishing will only improve as the salmon begin spawning.\n\nNorthern Pike:\n\nAnglers may retain as many pike as they catch - there is no bag or possession limit. In the freshwaters of West Cook Inlet the Knik Arm, and Susitna River drainage, anglers are not allowed to release live pike back into the water.\nRoadside, try Nancy, Big, Horseshoe, West Beaver, Long, Memory, Prator, Knik and Rainbow Lakes.\nFly-in to Trapper, Shell, Alexander, or Sucker Lakes.\n\nLocal Lakes\nLake fishing has been consistently excellent.

Fishing is open 7 days a week and bait and multiple hooks are allowed. Bag limits are 3 per day/ 3 in possession. Coho fishing is slow.\n\nRainbow Trout, Arctic Grayling, and Dolly Varden\n\nFlesh flies, and cotton candy will be good as fall fast approaches and rainbows search for flesh. Don’t rule out a strike indicator, they can be very helpful with hook sets.\nRainbow trout fishing should be good to excellent well into freeze up. Look for trout with the spawning coho during the last two weeks in September. When the waters do drop, target trout in deeper holes and near or below the mouths of streams draining into the Susitna. Flesh flies, beads, and sculpin patterns work well in late fall as the fish migrate to bigger waters to over winter.\n\nNorthern Pike\n\nFishing is best when water temperatures are lowest, such as early in the morning or late in the day.\nFor road-accessible pike fishing, try just about any lake in the Nancy Lake canoe system, plus Memory, Prator, and Big Lakes.\nFly-in fishing for pike can be excellent. Try Alexander or Trapper Lakes.\n\nLocal Lakes\n\nWith the cooler temperatures of fall approaching, Mat-Su Valley lakes provide excellent fishing as fish become much more active, and feed in shallower water.\nLake trout are stocked in Matanuska and Long Lake (mile 86).\nIn the Palmer/Wasilla area, Lorraine, Carpenter, Knik, Lucille, Kepler, Rocky, and Echo lakes are stocked with rainbow trout.\nLakes stocked with landlocked salmon are Matanuska, Finger, Beverly, Loberg and Klaire.\nArctic Char are stocked in Finger, Irene, Long, Lynne, Marion, Matanuska, Prator, and Seventeenmile lakes.\nAlong the Glenn Highway northeast of Palmer, Seventeenmile, Slipper, Long, Ravine, Weiner, Knob and North Knob lakes all have rainbow trout.\nWishbone Lake, X Lake, and Long Lake (Matanuska Lakes Complex) have special catch and release, single-hook restrictions and close to all fishing November 1st-April 30th.\n\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nEmergency Order 2-SS -2-47-24 Closes coho fishing in the Susitna river drainage (Units 1-6) and bait is prohibited.\nEmergency Order 2-SS-2-48-24 Closes coho fishing on the Knik arm streams.\nEmergency Order 2-22-2-61-24 reduces the bag and possession limit for coho in West Cook Inlet streams to two per day and four in possession.\n\nDon't forget to purchase your 2024 sport fishing license and king stamp!

Dredging is currently underway, and staff are evaluating sustainable solutions to this issue.\nAnglers are reminded that flowing waters in the Palmer-Wasilla Zone are CLOSED to all fishing until June 15. This includes Cottonwood Creek off Seward Meridian.\n\nLocal Lakes\n\nStay tuned to our stocking webpage for more information as the stocking truck has been active in the Mat-Su area.\nLakes recently stocked with rainbow trout include: Kepler/Bradley, Canoe, Lucile, and Matanuska.\nSpring is a great time to fish these stocks lakes. Both fly fishing and spin fishing tackle are effective at catching rainbow trout.\n\nPersonal Use\nIt’s early for hooligan on the Yentna and Susitna rivers, however, indicators of fish being here will be gulls along the sandbars. Once this fishery starts it is quick and usually over by the end of the month. These fish are available primarily by boat and Deshka Landing is the primary access.

We polled the staff and here are some of our favorite places to fish if you are looking for an adventure.\nThe whistle stop up the Parks Highway with the Alaska Railraod. You can get off the train departing from Talkeena by scheduling a train ride. Popular stops include Indian Creek, and Chulitna. Call ahead with your exact mile post for pick up and drop off to coordinate with the conductor. Bring your fishing and camping gear.\nIf you want a boating and camping adventure with world class rainbow trout and grayling fishing head up to Lake Creek or the Talachulitna River. All king salmon fishing is closed including catch and release.\nFor road accessible aesthetically pleasing mountain views, go towards Glennallen up the Glenn Highway. There are some beautiful places to get away and enjoy the mountain views. Bonnie Lake (MP 83.3) is not stocked but you will find peace and quiet with awesome grayling fishing. Lakes that are stocked with awesome trout fishing are Ravine (on the way to Bonnie), Long Lake Mile 86, Weiner Lake, or the two lakes down the Alascom Road MP 119 right before Eureka. We stock North Knob, and Knob Lakes with rainbow trout. Enjoy the glacier views on this road trip.\nBig Lake has a unique population of wild Arctic Char. This is a catch and release only fishery. If you are lucky enough to catch one of these fish the photos will be well worth it. These fish capitalize on the out-migration of sockeye salmon from Big Lake. Try smolt patterns near the outlet, or throw egg sucking leeches, Wolly Buggers, or shrimp patterns. If you are using spinning gear, try spoons or spinners, Spin-N-Glo with silver, gold, or fluorescent chartreuse, orange, or pink. If you are trolling, go nice and slow.\nFor the river wranglers, dunk your rafts or shore fish the Parks Highway streams. You can camp at Willow, Sheep, Caswell, Kashwitna (Su Landing), and Montana Creeks. Rafting is always a good time too. Montana and Willow Creeks steal the show in this category.\nWant to use the 4-wheelers and side-by-sides? We stock Wishbone Lake (catch and release only), Ruby Lake, and Goober Lakes. Jim Creek is always a good time with the glacier views, or you can head up to Jonesville Road and fish Slipper (Eska), or Coyote Lakes.\nWant a plane ride? If you have floats and want to catch a lot of pike, fly out to Alexander Lake. Bring your fillet knife and a big cooler, there is no bag limit for this invasive species. If you have big wheels you can land on the sand bars of the Tal or head up to Chelatna Lake for a beautiful flight and views of Denali.\nThe Eklutna Tailrace is producing a few more king salmon catches as of yesterday morning from the public access site. Remember to purchase your 2025 king salmon stamp along with your license for this fishery. You can record your catch with the new mobile app. Bait and multiple hooks are allowed in this fishery and it’s open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This fishery boundary is all waters within a ½ mile radius of its confluence with the Knik River, and to a Fish and Game marker 2 miles downstream of the confluence. You can boat up from the Knik bridge watch the tides, the launch is undeveloped.\n\nLocal Lakes\n\nLake fishing has been excellent.

The department must project more than 35,000 sockeye salmon prior to opening this dip net fishery. This fishery typically opens towards the end of July.\nThe Susitna personal use dipnet fishery first opener will be Saturday July 12 on the lower Susitna River. This fishery runs 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. on Wednesdays and Saturdays only from July 10 to July 31. The designated area for fishing is between regulatory markers posted approximately one mile downstream of Susitna Station (just below the Yentna River mouth) down to markers posted just below the Alexander Creek cut-off/northern tip of Bell Island. Access is by boat (18 miles) or plane only. Waters of the Susitna are dropping, providing more beach access in this fishery.\r\n\t\nThis fishery is part of the Upper Cook Inlet Personal Use permit. An Upper Cook Inlet Personal Use permit is required in addition to a sport fishing license. Only Alaska residents may participate in this fishery. Upper Cook Inlet Personal Use permit harvest and participation must be reported online no later than August 31 through the ADF&G harvest reporting webpage.\n\n\n\nRainbow Trout\n\nFishing for rainbows on the Parks Highway streams is good. Try Willow, Montana, Kashwitna, Little Willow, and Goose creeks. Fish wet flies like wooly buggers, leeches, sculpins and egg sucking leeches, soon beads will be the ticket. Grayling fishing has been good too. They like gold or yellow flies and lures, stick to small sizes. Try bead head nymphs, Elk Hair Caddis, Mayflies, or a good old Stone Fly.\nWillow Creek has multiple access points off Willow Fishhook Road. Montana Creek may be accessed at several locations off the Talkeetna Spur Road. Single day float trips are popular on Willow and Montana creeks.\nFurther north, tributaries of the Chulitna, such as Honolulu Creek and Byers Creek should also provide good rainbow trout fishing opportunities.\n\nNorthern Pike\n\nFor road-accessible pike fishing, try the Nancy Lake Recreation Area lakes, Big Lake, Long Lake near Willow, Memory, and Prator Lakes.\nBoat-accessible pike fishing can be found in the side sloughs of the Deshka River, Alexander Creek, Fish Creek (Kroto Slough), and Hewitt Lake.\nFor fly-in pike fishing try Alexander Lake, Shell Lake, Eightmile Lake, Trapper Lake, Flathorn Lake, and Sucker Lake.\n\nLocal Lakes\nSummit Lake in Hatcher Pass was recently stocked. This lake is in a beautiful spot and the road over the pass is open. Enjoy fishing and hiking while the summer weather is at its best. Other aesthetically pleasing lakes include the lakes up the Glenn HWY, Long Lake (Mile 86), Ravine, or Knob Lakes off the Alascom Road.\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nEmergency Order 2-KS-2-06-25 Closes the Susitna River drainage to sport fishing for king salmon. In addition, sport fishing gear is limited to one unbaited, single-hook, artificial lure with a gap between the point and shank of the hook that is one-half inch or less in the Susitna River drainage (Units 1-6).\nEmergency Order 2-KS-2-05-25 Closes the Little Susitna to sport fishing for king salmon and limits gear to one unbaited, single-hook, artificial lure with a gap of one-half inch or less when fishing for other species.\nEmergency Order 2-KS-2-11-25 Closes all waters of West Cook Inlet Management Area to sport fishing for king salmon.\n\nDon't forget to purchase your 2025 sport fishing license and king stamp!

The weather seems to be the most limiting factor right now.\nLots of folks have also been picking up halibut while trolling this spring.

Not many are holding in the river yet, and just a few have been caught so far.\nLitnik is getting a few sockeye with some fish schooling up in Afognak Bay.\n\nSaltwater Fishing \n\nThere are some dollies being caught from local beaches. Mission Beach, the mouth of the Buskin and Pillar Creek are annual favorites.\nKing salmon fishing has picked up with quite a few kings being caught over Memorial Day weekend. Fish are being found at the Fingers/Buoy 4 area and between Woody and Long Islands.\nHalibut are still being picked up trolling but also being caught jigging around Buoy 4, Kalsin Reef and behind Long Island.\nCod are being caught nearly everywhere, with Kalsin Reef and Kalsin Bay seeming to have a particularly high abundance, as well as trolling around Buoy 4 and the Fingers.\nRockfish are also being found at most reefs and rock structures in Chiniak Bay. Black rockfish are found at nearly every rock and reef, but other species such as dark, dusky, yellow tail and widow rockfish can often be found by fishing just a little bit deeper and to the sides of the same rocks and reefs.\nDon’t forget that lingcod season doesn’t open until July 1! There are already lots of reports of anglers catching lingcod, so plan ahead to release them unharmed.\n\nLocal Lakes \nThe higher elevation lakes, such as Heitman, are just thawing out and can make for great fishing on sunny days. Heitman is a great hike on a well warn trail, some of the best fishing can be along the steep banks just at the end of the trail.\nNew Species Information\n\nNew rockfish regulations will take effect June 1 for Kodiak and Afognak waters north of Dangerous and Outlet Capes. This includes all the waters of Afognak, Raspberry and Shuyak Islands as well as Chiniak, Ugak and Marmot Bays and all of Whale Pass and Kupreanof Straight. It is also in effect for all anglers, both resident and non-resident.\nAnglers fishing in these waters can keep 5 rockfish per day, but only 2 can be of a single species. This is similar to salmon bag limits in the Kodiak Road Zone. For example, an angler could harvest 2 black rockfish, 2 dusky rockfish and a yelloweye. Species ID guides are available in the Southwest Alaska Regulation Booklet, on the ADF&G website and in the Kodiak ADF&G office.\nThe standard bag limit for non-pelagic and yelloweye is still in effect Island wide, only 2 of your rockfish bag limit may be non-pelagic species and only one of these may be a yelloweye.\n\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nEmergency Order 2-RF-4-17-24 reduced the bag and possession limit for a single species of rockfish to 2 per day, 4 in possession north of Outlet Cape and Dangerous Cape.

Sounds like the water is pretty high but there are some fish in the lagoon.\nDollies are still in the Buskin with some in the lake and throughout the river too. Fishing can be good at times with the high water in places with some slower water or eddies.

Mission Beach, the mouth of the Buskin, and the beaches in Kalsin Bay and Chiniak are great spots to try.\nKing salmon fishing was pretty slow and not much effort occurred over the last week due to the weather.\nHalibut, cod and rockfish effort was low and few reports of folks venturing out to fish came in due to the weather.\nThis week looks nicer and most of the halibut and king salmon effort has been focused on the Fingers/Buoy 4 and between Woody and Long islands when the weather cooperates.\nRockfish are also being found at most reefs and rock structures in Chiniak Bay.

Weir counts are down as the weir is mostly underwater and counts are impossible. We are typically about a quarter of the way through the run right now but won’t be able to fully assess the state of the run until the water comes down.\nLitnik had a strong push of fish in the last couple days and counts are near the ten-year average. Fishing has been decent, though the high water will slow things down this week. There haven’t been large build ups of fish in the lagoon yet, but fish are moving up the river with the tides.\nThere’s been a few reports of fish seen at Pasagshak though doesn’t sound like anyone catching them yet. The weir will go in this week.\nStill some dollies around the Buskin, though they are fast leaving the freshwater to feed in the saltwater.\n\nSaltwater Fishing \n\nJune is prime time to fish dollies from local beaches. Mission Beach, the mouth of the Buskin, and the beaches in Kalsin Bay and Chiniak are great spots to catch dollies.\nKing salmon fishing has been decent when the weather cooperates. There has been very little effort in the last week due to the weather.\nHalibut fishing sounds really good when folks are able to get out with the Fingers and Williams Reef being good spots right now. Fish in the 40lb range sound fairly common.\nStill lots of cod around and they are likely to start moving into deeper water as the water warms up. Sounds like Kalsin Reef has a lot of cod right now.\nRockfish are also being found at most reefs and rock structures in Chiniak Bay. Black rockfish are found at nearly every rock and reef, but other species such as dark, dusky, yellow tail and widow rockfish can often be found by fishing just a little bit deeper and to the sides of the same rocks and reefs.\nDon’t forget that lingcod season doesn’t open until July 1! There are already lots of reports of anglers catching lingcod, so plan ahead to release them unharmed.\n\nLocal Lakes \nWith the poor weather, there haven’t been many reports of rainbow fishing in local lakes, but with the high water, fishing from shore can often be good. Twin Lake and Bull Lake, out at the end of the road, can be easier to fish when they are little more flooded and would be great lakes to check out.\nSpecial Species Information\n\nNew rockfish regulations took effect June 1 for Kodiak and Afognak waters north of Dangerous and Outlet Capes.

The bag limit was increased to 5 and sounds like the best fishing is below the markers at the weir or on the incoming tide near Bridge 1.\nLitnik sockeye have slowed down some and fishing typically starts to trail off about now. Fishing sounds slower than it was in June.\nThe Saltery sockeye run is also off to a strong start with over 6,000 counted. This is above the 10-year average and well ahead of the last several years.\nPasagshak is having a very strong run too with nearly 2,000 sockeye counted. Fishing sounds good at times but is always dependent on the tides at Pasagshak.\nThere have been no reports of hatchery kings being caught on the road system yet.\nPinks are just starting to show up around the road system with a few in the Buskin already.\n\nSaltwater Fishing \n\nKing salmon fishing has been good in the last week but the hot spots seem to shift around between Woody and Long Islands, Buoy 4 and the Fingers and Kalsin Bay.\nHalibut fishing has been great and fish in the 20-40 lb range are common. The most productive fishing has been in the areas further from town: Williams Reef, Triple Lumps, Cape Chiniak, Whale Pass.\nLingcod fishing has been good since it opened, with fish in the 15 lb range common. Quite a few have been caught at the Fingers reefs.\nRockfish are also being found at most reef and rock structures in Chiniak Bay. Lots of folks are adjusting to the new bag limits (see EO below) and rockfish ID guides are available in the harbors and at the ADF&G office.\nThis is a great time of year to fish for dollies from the beach. Mission Beach and the beaches in Kalsin Bay and Chiniak are great places to find dollies. Pinks should be showing up off these beaches too.\n\nLocal Lakes \nAurel, Caroline and Cicely Lakes in Bells Flats are consistently productive and have produced some good rainbows this season so far. They are a short hike up from Middle Bay Drive and if you need a map, they are available at the ADF&G office.\nSpecial Species Information\n\nNew rockfish regulations took effect June 1 for Kodiak and Afognak waters north of Dangerous and Outlet Capes. This includes all the waters of Afognak, Raspberry and Shuyak Islands as well as Chiniak, Ugak and Marmot Bays and all of Whale Pass and Kupreanof Strait. It is also in effect for all anglers, both resident and non-resident.\nAnglers fishing in these waters can keep 5 rockfish per day, but for only 2 can be of a single species. This is similar to salmon bag limits in the Kodiak Road Zone and an example would be that an angler could harvest 2 black rockfish, 2 dusky rockfish and a yelloweye. Species ID guides are available in the Southwest Alaska Regulation Booklet, on the ADF&G website and in the Kodiak ADF&G office.\nThe standard bag limit for non-pelagic and yelloweye is still in effect Island wide, only 2 of your rockfish bag limit may be non-pelagic species and only one of these may be a yelloweye.\n\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nNEW: Emergency Order 2-RS-4-36-24 increased the bag and possession limits for sockeye salmon to five fish in the Buskin River drainage.

They are starting to school up around most rivers on the road system and there are some fish building up at the Buskin, Olds and Russian.\nDolly fishing is picking up and most road system rivers have quite a few dollies in them. The Olds and Salonie have some big ones!\n\nSaltwater Fishing \n\nKing salmon fishing was excellent in the last week with a most effort right at Mission Beach. It seems to have slowed some over the weekend but there are still some fish being picked up. There are also some being found at the Fingers, Whale Pass and Chiniak.\nSilvers are slow to show up this year but some are being caught between Woody and Long Island, at Chiniak and some at Buoy 4 and the Fingers. There don’t seem to be large schools of silvers built up yet, though.\nHalibut fishing has been good with lots of fish still being picked up trolling for salmon. Most of the reefs North of town have been productive as well as Chiniak and even between the Islands.\nLingcod fishing has been excellent with lots of fish in the 15lb range around and quite a few being caught trolling.\nRockfish are also plentiful but now is the time to practice your rockfish ID and take advantage of the increased limit for rockfish. ADF&G has rockfish ID guides if you need one! Dusky rockfish have been plentiful at the Fingers.\nPinks are building up off the beaches at Chiniak and at Pillar Creek. Catching pinks in the saltwater is a blast and they are good eating when they are bright.\n\nLocal Lakes \nTwo lakes on Woody Island are stocked with rainbow trout, Long Lake on the North end of the Island in the State Park and Tanignak Lake adjacent to the camp. Both are productive with Tanignak consistently producing fish over 20”. Long Lake is also the site of a new State Parks cabin available for rent and a nearby dock that provides fishing opportunities and a place to tie your boat up.\nSpecial Species Information\n\nNew rockfish regulations took effect June 1 for Kodiak and Afognak waters north of Dangerous and Outlet Capes. This includes all the waters of Afognak, Raspberry and Shuyak Islands as well as Chiniak, Ugak and Marmot Bays and all of Whale Pass and Kupreanof Strait. It is also in effect for all anglers, both resident and non-resident.\nAnglers fishing in these waters can keep 5 rockfish per day, but for only 2 can be of a single species. This is similar to salmon bag limits in the Kodiak Road Zone and an example would be that an angler could harvest 2 black rockfish, 2 dusky rockfish and a yelloweye. Species ID guides are available in the Southwest Alaska Regulation Booklet, on the ADF&G website and in the Kodiak ADF&G office.\nThe standard bag limit for non-pelagic and yelloweye is still in effect Island wide, only 2 of your rockfish bag limit may be non-pelagic species and only one of these may be a yelloweye.\nSome anglers have commented on black rockfish being the only rockfish they are able to catch. When looking for other species, like dark or dusky rockfish look to the deeper part of reefs and pinnacles and fish closer to the bottom and off to the side of the shallower areas. Black rockfish will often be up off the bottom and in the shallowest water.\n\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nEmergency Order 2-RS-4-36-24 increased the bag and possession limits for sockeye salmon to five fish in the Buskin River drainage. The combined bag limit for sockeye, chum and pink salmon remains at five fish, of these two may be coho salmon through September 15.\nEmergency Order 2-RF-4-17-24 reduced the bag and possession limit for a single species of rockfish to 2 per day, 4 in possession north of Outlet Cape and Dangerous Cape. This emergency order is in effect from Saturday June 1, 2024 through 11:59 pm. Tuesday, December 31, 2024.\nEmergency Order 2-KS-4-16-24 closed the Karluk River drainage (including the lagoon and its outlet stream) and the Ayakulik River drainage to king salmon fishing and restricted fishing gear to only one unbaited, single-hook artificial lure through 11:59 p.m. Tuesday, December 31, 2024.\nEmergency Order 2-RS-4-37-24 increases the bag and possession limits for sockeye salmon to four fish in the Pasagshak River drainage. The combined bag limit for sockeye, chum and pink salmon remains at five fish, 20 inches or greater in length, of these, two may be coho salmon through September 15. From September 16 through December 31, the bag limit for coho salmon is one fish, 20 inches or greater in length. This regulatory change is effective 12:01 a.m. Thursday, July 11 through 11:59 p.m. Tuesday, December 31, 2024.\nEmergency Order 2-RS-4-38-24 increases the bag and possession limits for salmon, other than king salmon, to 10 fish in the Saltery Cove drainage all of which can be sockeye salmon, but only 5 may be chum and pink salmon, and two can be coho salmon, 20 inches or greater in length.

They are still very bright, so now is the time to get bright pinks!\nThe Saltery sockeye run is still going and while the weir was pulled last week, there are still sockeye coming in the river and should be through the end of August. There are quite a few pinks in the river now too.\nPasagshak is still getting decent numbers of sockeye and in the last several years the run has continued through the end of August.\nA few silvers have shown up in the Buskin and up on Afognak so far but it’s a slow start similar to the last several years.\nDolly fishing has been excellent with lots of fish being caught in the Buskin, Pasagshak, Salonie and Olds rivers.\n\nSaltwater Fishing \n\nKing salmon fishing has been hit and miss again. There are still fish being caught in front of Mission Beach but a lot of effort has shifted to Chiniak and over to Whale Pass.

It’s a moderate hike up to the lake from the road and offers great rainbow trout fishing. There are not many very large fish in the lake but lots of fish in the 12-16” range, and the best fishing is often right where the trail meets the lake.\nSpecial Species Information\n\nNew rockfish regulations took effect June 1 for Kodiak and Afognak waters north of Dangerous and Outlet Capes.

Overall, there are not as many pinks as other recent years, but plenty to go get a limit. Popular spots have been Buskin and the Olds.\nDolly fishing continues to be good with dollies following salmon runs in the rivers. Some big fish have been caught this year and Buskin and Salonie seem to be the hot spots.\n\nSaltwater Fishing \n\nKing salmon fishing has been slower around town but some fish are being caught between Woody and Long Islands and off of Chiniak. There are a lot of jellyfish in the water coating trolling gear, fish deeper in the water to avoid them. Whale pass has been decent fishing at times for king salmon.\nSilvers have been slower around town with some being caught at Chiniak, some are also being found at Whale Pass for trolling. Silvers are starting to school up in the lagoons on Afognak and closer to town at Mill Bay and in Monashka Bay. There have been some caught off the beach at Buskin as well.\nThere are still quite a few bright pinks available off the beaches right now. Pillar, Buskin and the Chiniak beaches all have quite a few pinks still.

This includes all the waters of Afognak, Raspberry and Shuyak Islands as well as Chiniak, Ugak and Marmot Bays and all of Whale Pass and Kupreanof Strait. It is also in effect for all anglers, both resident and non-resident.\nAnglers fishing in these waters can keep 5 rockfish per day, but for only 2 can be of a single species. This is similar to salmon bag limits in the Kodiak Road Zone and an example would be that an angler could harvest 2 black rockfish, 2 dusky rockfish and a yelloweye. Species ID guides are available in the Southwest Alaska Regulation Booklet, on the ADF&G website and in the Kodiak ADF&G office.\nThe standard bag limit for non-pelagic and yelloweye is still in effect Island wide, only 2 of your rockfish bag limit may be non-pelagic species and only one of these may be a yelloweye.\nSome anglers have commented on black rockfish being the only rockfish they are able to catch. When looking for other species, like dark or dusky rockfish look to the deeper part of reefs and pinnacles and fish closer to the bottom and off to the side of the shallower areas. Black rockfish will often be up off the bottom and in the shallowest water.\n\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nEmergency Order 2-RS-4-53-24 increased the bag and possession limits for sockeye salmon to ten fish in the South Olga Lakes (Upper Station) drainage. The combined bag limit for salmon is ten fish, of which no more than five can be a combination of coho, chum or pink salmon.\nEmergency Order 2-RS-4-36-24 increased the bag and possession limits for sockeye salmon to five fish in the Buskin River drainage. The combined bag limit for sockeye, chum and pink salmon remains at five fish, of these two may be coho salmon through September 15.\nEmergency Order 2-RF-4-17-24 reduced the bag and possession limit for a single species of rockfish to 2 per day, 4 in possession north of Outlet Cape and Dangerous Cape. This emergency order is in effect from Saturday June 1, 2024 through 11:59 pm. Tuesday, December 31, 2024.\nEmergency Order 2-KS-4-16-24 closed the Karluk River drainage (including the lagoon and its outlet stream) and the Ayakulik River drainage to king salmon fishing and restricted fishing gear to only one unbaited, single-hook artificial lure through 11:59 p.m. Tuesday, December 31, 2024.\nEmergency Order 2-RS-4-37-24 increases the bag and possession limits for sockeye salmon to four fish in the Pasagshak River drainage. The combined bag limit for sockeye, chum and pink salmon remains at five fish, 20 inches or greater in length, of these, two may be coho salmon through September 15. From September 16 through December 31, the bag limit for coho salmon is one fish, 20 inches or greater in length. This regulatory change is effective 12:01 a.m. Thursday, July 11 through 11:59 p.m. Tuesday, December 31, 2024.\nEmergency Order 2-RS-4-38-24 increases the bag and possession limits for salmon, other than king salmon, to 10 fish in the Saltery Cove drainage all of which can be sockeye salmon, but only 5 may be chum and pink salmon, and two can be coho salmon, 20 inches or greater in length.

Hot spots have been the Olds, Pasagshak, Sargent and Salonie. There are some fish in the American and Buskin but it’s a little slower at these spots.\nSaltery Cove has been having a great coho run this season and is one of the better spots.\nStocked returns to Pillar and Monashka creeks have been slow now, though it’s hard to say if its just early or the returns are small.\nAfognak coho runs continue to do well but will be slowing down from here on out. Fishing is still good at Litnik and most southern Afognak runs.\nThere are still a few bright pinks around too, with some in the Buskin and at Pillar Creek.\nDolly fishing at the Buskin has been awesome, with the Lake and upper river having lots of dollies. They are starting to get some color to them as well.\n\nSaltwater Fishing \n\nKing salmon fishing continues to be slow around town and most success has been reported at Whale Pass and in Ugak Bay. Very few fish have been found in the Chiniak Bay area and fishing seems to be hit and miss everywhere else.\nThere are still some coho being picked up in Whale Pass, and it sounds like Ugak Bay still has good fishing for folks willing to make the trip. Chiniak Bay and places close to town are very slow.\nMonashka Bay is starting to get some coho schooling up but fishing is slow for the most part. There are some jumpers in the bay and a few fish here and there but not many caught. There are some fish in Mill Bay and at Mission Beach but it sounds slow for the most part too.\nHalibut fishing was slower in the last week with many anglers commenting on only finding smaller fish. The weather wasn’t the best, so that likely slowed fishing down, but halibut fishing often slows down around this time as fish move towards shallower waters in search of salmon.\nLingcod fishing on the other hand, has been excellent with lots of fish in the 15lb range around. They are being found at most reefs around Chiniak Bay and beyond.\nRockfish are also plentiful and remember that the new rockfish regulations are very similar to salmon bag limits.

The Olds and Pasagshak have decent numbers of fish but seem about average. While the American, Pillar and Monashka haven’t had many fish yet this season. Fishing has been best first thing in the morning.\nBuskin River weir counts have fallen a bit due to the dry weather, but there are good numbers of fish building up in the lower river and decent schools of fish in the salt water off the mouth. Fishing has been good at times but there is a lot of fishing pressure.\nSaltery Cove has been having a great coho run this season and is one of the better spots so far, but the warm weather often makes fishing slower.\nDolly fishing at the Buskin has been awesome, with the Lake and upper river having lots of dollies. They are starting to get some color to them as well. Other popular locations for dollies are the American and Salonie. There are plenty of dollies around, but sounds like they are getting picky and mostly only going for beads right now.\n\nSaltwater Fishing \n\nWhale Pass is still the place to go for kings right now, with most of the usual places near town being unproductive. Ugak Bay has also been productive for kings at times.\nThere haven’t been any reports of good coho fishing in the salt water right now. The likely place is Monashka and Mill Bays but there aren’t the same large schools of coho salmon this year as last year.\nHalibut fishing sounds like its slowed down recently but, when the weather allows, people are finding some fish on the outer reefs like Williams Reef and Triple Lumps.\nLingcod fishing has been good at most reefs in Chiniak Bay and beyond and anglers continue to find 15-20lb lingcod regularly.\nRockfish are also plentiful and remember that the new rockfish regulations are very similar to salmon bag limits. You can have a total limit of 5 rockfish, that can be any combination of species as long as you have no more than 2 of each species or only 1 yelloweye.\n\nLocal Lakes \nFall is often a great time to find wild rainbows in Buskin and Saltery lakes as they follow spawning salmon up into the lakes. Look for schools of salmon and target the areas around them or behind them or focus on the mouths of tributary streams coming into the lakes for the best rainbow fishing. Remember that it is catch and release for rainbow trout in road system drainages unless they are actively stocked by ADF&G and KRAA.\nSpecial Species Information\n\nNew rockfish regulations took effect June 1 for Kodiak and Afognak waters north of Dangerous and Outlet Capes.

A few more fish have started to show up in the last week, it is possible a large push could happen in October as it has in the past.\nRemember, other than stocked runs, the coho bag limit reduced to 1 fish by regulation on September 16.\nThe American River was closed by Emergency Order due to a weak run. Dolly fishing is allowed, but bait is prohibited.\nThe Buskin is having an average run compared to recent years, though counts are low at the weir when compared to long term averages. With the bag limit at 1 fish now, further restrictions are unlikely this season.\nSaltery Cove has had a good run, but fishing has been tougher with the warm weather. Larger sized fish have been caught this year. Reminder: Board of Fisheries changed the bag limit at Saltery, Miam and Sacramento to 2 coho per day, year round for those who want to make the trek.\nStocked returns to Pillar and Monashka creeks have been slow, there was an early push of fish, but not many fish have been found schooling in Monashka Bay and fishing has been slow in the rivers.\nDolly fishing at the Buskin has been great, with the Lake and upper river having lots of dollies at the moment. They are starting to get some color to them. There are quite a few dollies to be found at the American and Salonie as well.\n\nSaltwater Fishing \n\nCoho salmon fishing has been slow in the saltwater. A few jumpers and small schools have been seen in front of Pillar Beach, and a few in front of the Buskin.\nKing salmon fishing continues to be slow around town but folks are finding them at Whale Pass and in Ugak Bay still. Effort has dropped off almost completely in Chiniak Bay.\nHalibut fishing was slower in the last week with many anglers reporting only small fish. Some fish have been caught around Chiniak and between the Islands and in Whale Pass.\nLingcod fishing, has been excellent with lots of fish in the 15lb range around. They are being found at most reefs around Chiniak Bay and beyond.\nRockfish are also plentiful and remember that the new rockfish regulations are very similar to salmon bag limits. You can have a total limit of 5 rockfish, that can be any combination of species as long as you have no more than 2 of each species or only 1 yelloweye.\n\nLocal Lakes \nRainbow fishing in most local lakes was slower in the last week, likely due to all of the rain we had. Some of the more remote lakes we stock are found on Woody and Long Islands. Dolgoi Lake on Long Island and Long Lake and Tanignak Lake on Woody Island are all stocked with rainbows. These lakes have been stocked nearly continuously since at least 1953.\nSpecial Species Information\n\nCoho salmon bag limits in the Kodiak Road Zone change throughout the season. Most rivers change from a 2 fish bag limit to a 1 fish bag limit on September 16 annually.\nExceptions to this are that the stocked waters in Pillar and Monashka creeks and saltwaters of Monashka Bay, Mill Bay and Mission Beach remain at 2 year-round, as well as Saltery, Miam and Sacramento drainages.\nRoad Zone waters also include saltwaters in front of most local drainages such as Buskin. See the map on page 23 of the Southwest Alaska Regulations Summary Booklet.\nNew rockfish regulations took effect June 1 for Kodiak and Afognak waters north of Dangerous and Outlet Capes. This includes all the waters of Afognak, Raspberry and Shuyak Islands as well as Chiniak, Ugak and Marmot Bays and all of Whale Pass and Kupreanof Strait. It is also in effect for all anglers, both resident and non-resident.\nAnglers fishing in these waters can keep 5 rockfish per day, but for only 2 can be of a single species. This is similar to salmon bag limits in the Kodiak Road Zone and an example would be that an angler could harvest 2 black rockfish, 2 dusky rockfish and a yelloweye. Species ID guides are available in the Southwest Alaska Regulation Booklet, on the ADF&G website and in the Kodiak ADF&G office.\nThe standard bag limit for non-pelagic and yelloweye is still in effect Island wide, only 2 of your rockfish bag limit may be non-pelagic species and only one of these may be a yelloweye.\n\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nNEW! Emergency Order 2-SS-4-64-24 closed the American River drainage to sport fishing for coho salmon and prohibited the use of bait in the drainage.\nEmergency Order 2-RS-4-53-24 increased the bag and possession limits for sockeye salmon to ten fish in the South Olga Lakes (Upper Station) drainage.

This emergency order is in effect from Saturday June 1, 2024 through 11:59 pm. Tuesday, December 31, 2024.\nEmergency Order 2-KS-4-16-24 closed the Karluk River drainage (including the lagoon and its outlet stream) and the Ayakulik River drainage to king salmon fishing and restricted fishing gear to only one unbaited, single-hook artificial lure through 11:59 p.m. Tuesday, December 31, 2024.\nEmergency Order 2-RS-4-37-24 increases the bag and possession limits for sockeye salmon to four fish in the Pasagshak River drainage. The combined bag limit for sockeye, chum and pink salmon remains at five fish, 20 inches or greater in length, of these, two may be coho salmon through September 15. From September 16 through December 31, the bag limit for coho salmon is one fish, 20 inches or greater in length. This regulatory change is effective 12:01 a.m. Thursday, July 11 through 11:59 p.m. Tuesday, December 31, 2024.\nEmergency Order 2-RS-4-38-24 increases the bag and possession limits for salmon, other than king salmon, to 10 fish in the Saltery Cove drainage all of which can be sockeye salmon, but only 5 may be chum and pink salmon, and two can be coho salmon, 20 inches or greater in length. Anglers may not harvest more than 10 salmon per day or possess more than 10 total salmon, all species combined.

This fishing report will be updated when additional information is available in the spring. For current seasonal information, please contact the Anchorage office at (907) 267-2218.\nFreshwater Fishing \n\nCoho runs in Road System river are average, there is a possibility of pushes of coho all the way through October. The Buskin, Pillar Creek, Monashka, Olds and Salonie have all seen decent returns through October.\r\n\t\nReminder: other than stocked runs, the coho bag limit reduced to 1 fish by regulation on September 16.\n\n\nThe Buskin weir was pulled on September 30, however there are still fish in the lower river and fish coming in with the larger tides. The best fishing will be after rain events.\nThe American River was closed by Emergency Order due to a weak run. Dolly fishing is allowed, but bait is prohibited.\nSaltery Cove and Pasagshak had some of the better coho runs this season and fish should continue to come in through most of October.\nADF&G staff will be out monitoring spawning coho in most road system drainages this fall as well as tagging fish in Lake Rose Teed.\nDolly fishing at the Buskin has been great, with the Lake and upper river having lots of dollies. They are starting to get some color to them. There are quite a few dollies to be found at the American and Salonie as well. Remember that bait is prohibited in Road System drainages on November 1.\n\nSaltwater Fishing \n\nKing salmon fishing picked up at the end of September with a few fish caught between Woody and Long Islands. Buoy 4 and the Fingers is often a popular fall/winter spot when the weather allows.\nHalibut fishing slowed down a fair amount in September but should pick back up in October and into early November before fish head for deeper waters.\nLingcod fishing, has been excellent with lots of fish in the 15lb range. Halibut are being found at most reefs around Chiniak Bay and beyond. Remember Lingcod season closes January 1.\nRockfish are also plentiful and remember that the new rockfish regulations are very similar to salmon bag limits. You can have a total limit of 5 rockfish, that can be any combination of species as long as you have no more than 2 of each species or only 1 yelloweye.\n\nLocal Lakes \nFall rainbow fishing can be excellent in our stocked lakes. Bait is allowed in stocked lakes year round as well. Check out some of the higher elevation lakes before they freeze: Heitman, Lee, Aurel, Cicely and Caroline are all great fall fishing for rainbows.\nSpecial Species Information\n\nCoho salmon bag limits in the Kodiak Road Zone change throughout the season.

Fishing towards the mouth sounds like the most productive.\nLitnik is getting a few sockeye as well with 259 counted through the weir.\nDollies have pretty much all left freshwaters now and are headed for the ocean. Dolly fishing in Buskin Lake and River is slow.\n\nSaltwater Fishing\n\nThere are some dollies being caught from local beaches. Mission Beach, the mouth of the Buskin and Pillar Creek are the annual favorites.\nKing salmon fishing was good over Memorial Day weekend. Fish are being found at the Fingers/Buoy 4 area and between Woody and Long Islands. A few have been caught in Kalsin Bay.\nRemember that there are two emergency orders changing regulations for saltwater king salmon fishing in the Kodiak Area in effect this season. See below.\nHalibut are being caught frequently with the best fishing reported in 180+ ft of water. Kodiak Rocks, Kalsin Reef and Triple Lumps are early season favorites.\nCod are being caught nearly everywhere, with an abundance in between Woody and Long Islands as well as near Kalsin Reef and in Kalsin Bay.\nRockfish are also being found at most reefs and rock structures in Chiniak Bay. Black rockfish are found at nearly every rock and reef, but other species such as dark, dusky, yellow tail and widow rockfish can often be found by fishing just a little bit deeper and to the sides of the same rocks and reefs. See Special Species Information and Emergency Orders below for more about rockfish.\nDon’t forget that lingcod season doesn’t open until July 1! There are already lots of reports of anglers catching lingcod, so plan ahead to release them unharmed.\n\nLocal Lakes\nSpring fishing in stocked lakes has been excellent so far with good catches reported in the Bells Flats, Dragonfly and Horseshoe lakes. With things warming up a little earlier this year, fish are already active and feeding in these lakes with the lower elevation lakes being the warmest. Lots of insect hatches are happening daily and the rainbows are feeding aggressively.\nSpecial Species Information\n\n\nNew rockfish regulations took effect April 1 for Kodiak and Afognak waters north of Dangerous and Cape Ikolik. This includes all the waters of Afognak, Raspberry and Shuyak Islands as well as Chiniak, Ugak and Marmot Bays and all of Whale Pass, Kupreanof Straight and the Westside of Kodiak Island. It is also in effect for all anglers, both resident and non-resident.\nAnglers fishing in these waters can keep 5 rockfish per day, but only 2 can be of a single species. This is similar to salmon bag limits in the Kodiak Road Zone and an example would be that an angler could harvest 2 black rockfish, 2 dusky rockfish and a yelloweye. Species ID guides are available in the Southwest Alaska Regulation Booklet, on the ADF&G website and in the Kodiak ADF&G office.\nThe standard bag limit for yelloweye rockfish is still in effect Island wide, only one fish of your rockfish bag limit may be a yelloweye.\nAfter similar regulations were implemented last season, many anglers found that shifting their fishing behavior slightly resulted in increased rockfish catches of species other than Black Rockfish, which are typically most commonly caught. Dark Rockfish, Dusky Rockfish and other species can often be found just off the side of a rock pile or reef and in deeper water than black rockfish that typically prefer the top of and middle of these structures.\nKeep an eye out for some of the species you may not have realized we have in Kodiak: Widow, Yellowtail, Canary, Tiger, Northern and Silvergray rockfish are some of these.\nNew for Kodiak waters are Emergency Orders restricting saltwater king salmon harvest. The Island-wide king salmon bag limit has been reduced to 1 fish per day, with no annual limit to align with the rest of the Gulf of Alaska for the 2025 season.\nIn addition to this, the Westside of Kodiak has been closed to saltwater king salmon fishing through June 30 to protect king salmon returning to Karluk and Ayakulik Rivers. Only 76 king salmon were counted in the Karluk River last season which was by far the lowest count on record.\n\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nEmergency Order 2-RF-4-19-25 reduced the bag and possession limit for a single species of rockfish to 2 per day, 4 in possession north of Outlet Cape and Cape Ikolik. This emergency order is in effect from Tuesday April 1, 2025 through 11:59 pm. Wednesday, December 31, 2025.\nEmergency Order 2-KS-4-12-25 closed the Karluk River drainage (including the lagoon and its outlet stream) and the Ayakulik River drainage to king salmon fishing and restricted fishing gear to only one unbaited, single-hook artificial lure through 11:59 p.m. Friday, July 25, 2025.\nEmergency Order 2-KS-4-16-25 reduce the bag and possession limit for king salmon in the Kodiak Area to 1 per day from 12:01am Tuesday, April 1, 2025 through 11:59 p.m. Monday, September 15, 2025.\nEmergency Order 2-KS-4-18-25 closed the saltwaters of the Westside of Kodiak Island from Outlet Cape to Cape Ikolik to king salmon fishing from 12:01am Thursday, May 1, 2025 through 11:59 p.m. Monday, June 30, 2025.\n\nDon't forget to purchase your 2025 sport fishing license and king stamp!

Both can have very productive fishing and East Twin often gets credit for producing the largest fish from our stocking program. Bull is a short drive out the cattle ranch road on Pasagshak Point and is easily fishable from shore, however it is quite shallow near shore and spin fishing is best for reaching deeper water. East Twin is at the very end of the road at Fossil Beach and the stocked lake is on the east side of the rode vs. the smaller shallower lake on the west side that is not stocked with rainbows.\nSpecial Species Information\n\nNew rockfish regulations took effect April 1 for Kodiak and Afognak waters north of Dangerous and Cape Ikolik.

Weir counts are up to 3,700 fish and about a third of the way through the run.\nLitnik had a strong start and is about average for the sockeye run right now. Catches seem about average too, but in recent years, the run has continued to come in later than average, well into August.\nSome effort has started to shift out to Pasagshak and Saltery, but no sockeye have been counted at Pasagshak yet and the weir is being installed at Saltery this week.\nNo word on hatchery king salmon yet, but returns are only expected at Salonie and Monashka this year.\nDollies are still being caught off local beaches now with the mouth of the Buskin, Mission Beach and the beaches in Kalsin and Chiniak being the usual hot spots.\n\nSaltwater Fishing\n\nKing salmon fishing continues to be good between Woody and Long Islands and up in Danger Bay. There has been some recent effort in the Woody/Near Island channel and near the buoys off Spruce Cape as well but its been sporadic.\nRemember that there are two emergency orders changing regulations for saltwater king salmon fishing in the Kodiak Area in effect this season. See below.\nSome halibut are being caught between Woody and Long Islands and out at the Fingers from folks trolling. The normal spots in Chiniak Bay have been productive too: Triple Lumps, Cape Chiniak, behind Long Island.\nRockfish are being found at most reefs and rock structures in Chiniak Bay like normal. Black rockfish are found at nearly every rock and reef, but other species such as dark, dusky, yellow tail and widow rockfish can often be found by fishing just a little bit deeper and to the sides of the same rocks and reefs. See Special Species Information and Emergency Orders below for more about rockfish.\nLingcod season doesn’t open until July 1! There are already lots of reports of anglers catching lingcod, so plan ahead to release them unharmed.\n\nLocal Lakes\nThere are two lakes on Cliff Point that are stocked with rainbows and both have been productive this spring. Neither are known for large fish, with both producing fish mostly in the 12-18” range, but both can produce good catches. Dragonfly Lake is out Cliff Point Road about 1 mile past the Chiniak Highway turn off and before the gate. Public Access is allowed to the lake, but most vehicles won’t be able to drive to the lake and hiking in or ATV access is recommended. Horseshoe Lake is the next pull off from the Chiniak Highway and is a 15 minute hike from the road.\nSpecial Species Information\n\nNew rockfish regulations took effect April 1 for Kodiak and Afognak waters north of Dangerous and Cape Ikolik. This includes all the waters of Afognak, Raspberry and Shuyak Islands as well as Chiniak, Ugak and Marmot Bays and all of Whale Pass, Kupreanof Straight and the Westside of Kodiak Island. It is also in effect for all anglers, both resident and non-resident.\nAnglers fishing in these waters can keep 5 rockfish per day, but only 2 can be of a single species. This is similar to salmon bag limits in the Kodiak Road Zone and an example would be that an angler could harvest 2 black rockfish, 2 dusky rockfish and a yelloweye. Species ID guides are available in the Southwest Alaska Regulation Booklet, on the ADF&G website and in the Kodiak ADF&G office.\nThe standard bag limit for yelloweye rockfish is still in effect Island wide, only one fish of your rockfish bag limit may be a yelloweye.\nAfter similar regulations were implemented last season, many anglers found that shifting their fishing behavior slightly resulted in increased rockfish catches of species other than black rockfish, which are typically most commonly caught. Dark rockfish, dusky rockfish and other species can often be found just off the side of a rock pile or reef and in deeper water than black rockfish that typically prefer the top of and middle of these structures.\nKeep an eye out for some of the species you may not have realized we have in Kodiak: Widow, yellowtail, canary, tiger, northern and silvergray rockfish are some of these.\nNew for Kodiak waters are Emergency Orders restricting saltwater king salmon harvest. The Island-wide king salmon bag limit has been reduced to 1 fish per day, with no annual limit to align with the rest of the Gulf of Alaska for the 2025 season.\nIn addition to this, the Westside of Kodiak has been closed to saltwater king salmon fishing through June 30 to protect king salmon returning to Karluk and Ayakulik Rivers. Only 76 king salmon were counted in the Karluk River last season which was by far the lowest count on record.\n\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nEmergency Order 2-RF-4-19-25 reduced the bag and possession limit for a single species of rockfish to 2 per day, 4 in possession north of Outlet Cape and Cape Ikolik. This emergency order is in effect from Tuesday April 1, 2025 through 11:59 pm.

Fishing reports are still mixed but good numbers of fish continue to enter the river. Fishing sounds best in the stretch above the Beaver Pond and on incoming tides at the mouth.\nLitnik sockeye counts slowed down over the past week but there are still some fish around. There is a good build up in the lagoon right now and fish are moving up with the tides.\nSaltery is continuing to get some early fish with about 900 counted. This is a little below average but above last year when fish came in a little later and very strong. The water is fairly high lately, so fishing is a little tougher in holes like the Bed Springs.\nPasagshak has over 700 sockeye counted through the weir and fish continue to come in with each tide. Fishing has been excellent from most reports. And the mouth of the river is open at the moment, having been blocked for just 1 day.\nNo word on hatchery king salmon yet, returns are expected at Salonie and Monashka this year but have been very small runs recently and expected to be the same in 2025.\nDollies are still being caught off local beaches now with the mouth of the Buskin, Mission Beach and the beaches in Kalsin and Chiniak being the usual hot spots.\n\nSaltwater Fishing\n\nKing salmon fishing was good over the weekend at the Fingers and Buoy 4 area. Fish are still being found between Woody and Long and in the channel off Spruce Cape. Most fish are in the 8-12 lb range. The Westside of the Island opens to saltwater king salmon fishing July 1 but remains at the area wide bag limit of 1 per day.\nSome silvers are starting to be found trolling now, with some recent success at the Fingers. Lots of pinks showed up over the weekend as well, so you may need to sift through pinks to find silvers and kings.\nHalibut are being found in the usual places in Chiniak Bay with fish in the 20-40 lb range being most common. Kodiak Rocks, Buoy 4 and between Woody and Long Islands have been spots with recent success.\nRockfish fishing has been good with most rock piles and reefs in Chiniak Bay producing good catches. Lots of folks are figuring out the new rockfish regulations and having success finding a variety of species after they fill their limit of 2 black rockfish. Duskies can often be found in places that are common for trolling for salmon and are a good option to pursue. They tend to move around more than other species to feed on traveling schools of bait fish.\nLingcod season opens on Tuesday July 1, lots of lingcod have been encountered fishing for other species and sounds like there are quite a few of various sizes around.\n\nLocal Lakes\nIf you have Coast Guard base access or a friend that can sponsor you to get on, the pond on Nyman’s Peninsula, often called Lilly Pad Lake offers surprisingly good fishing. Rainbows in the 10-14” range can be easily caught from shore and from a boat, float tube, or paddle board.\nSpecial Species Information\n\nNew rockfish regulations took effect April 1 for Kodiak and Afognak waters north of Dangerous and Cape Ikolik.

The limit is still 5 per day until more fish are counted at the weir. There sounds like decent numbers of fish holding from the Bed Springs to the Weir.\nPasagshak has counted about 1,100 sockeye, though recent rains flooded the weir. From most accounts, there have been a lot of fish coming in the river and fishing has been good with each tide.\nPinks are starting to show up around town and in many rivers. The Buskin is starting to get pinks and fishing near the mouth and from the beach should be good for bright pinks.\nNo word on hatchery king salmon. Returns are expected at Salonie and Monashka this year but have been very small runs recently and expected to be the same in 2025.\nDollies are still being caught off local beaches now with the mouth of the Buskin, Mission Beach and the beaches in Kalsin and Chiniak being the usual hot spots.\n\nSaltwater Fishing\n\nKing salmon fishing was good for the few days the weather was calm enough.

Pinks are starting to get thick as well.\nHalibut are being found in the usual places in Chiniak Bay with fish in the 20-40 lb range being most common.

Lily and Dark Lakes have the best fishing by most accounts but fishing from shore is a little tougher due to private land ownership around much of the lake shore.

Although water conditions are good, expect the fishing to be slow as there are very few king salmon staged in the river this early in the run. Try cured salmon roe under a slip bobber. Size 4 or 5 pink or chartreuse spinners could be effective, too. If you incidentally hook a steelhead or wild king salmon, get them to the bank as quickly as possible and release them without removing them from the water.\n\nSaltwater Fishing \nKachemak Bay/Cook Inlet\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing is off to a slow start but should continue to improve. More consistent success is coming from offshore locations but those looking for bigger fish could try shallow water from Bluff Point to Anchor Point. Fishing around slack tide is the best time for targeting halibut so you can hold the bottom with less weight. Herring on a circle hook is the most popular bait; however, octopus, salmon heads, and jigs also work well\nKing Salmon\nKing salmon fishing south of Bluff Point has been spotty, with scattered reports from the Bluff area as well as throughout inner Kachemak Bay. Spawning herring have been spotted within the bay, with better fishing at times near those schools. Small troll herring or spoons behind a flasher is the most popular setup, but hootchies and tube flies will also produce fish. To find king salmon at any location, try setting the gear at different depths including mid-water column and 10 feet off the bottom.\nRockfish\nRockfish can be caught throughout Kachemak Bay and Cook Inlet by jigging or trolling. Don’t forget to use a deepwater release mechanism if you need to release one, and keep in mind that the bag limit has been reduced to 3.\nRazor Clams\nWest Cook Inlet is open to razor clamming, but east Cook Inlet is closed. Access to west Cook Inlet is primarily by charter boat from the tractor launch at Deep Creek, but private boats and planes are also used. Tides will be large enough by the end of the week to dig for clams. The most popular locations are Polly Creek, Crescent River Bar, and Clam Cove in Chinitna Bay. Digging has been good to excellent in recent seasons.\nSurf Fishing\nSurf fishing on Cook Inlet beaches has been slow to fair recently. Anglers are catching a variety of groundfish including halibut, sculpins, skates, sharks, flounders, and cod. Regulations changed at the December 2023 Board of Fisheries meeting to allow surf fishing for groundfish in the conservation zones surrounding the Anchor River, Deep Creek and Ninilchik River. You still may not fish within 200 yards of the stream mouths – look out for posted orange regulatory signs. Don’t forget about fishing off the tip of the Homer Spit – that location can be productive for a variety of groundfish.\nLocal Lakes\nThe Homer Reservoir (located on Skyline Drive) is a great place to take kids and catch a Dolly Varden. The fish are small, but can be voracious. Dollies are often found along the shore by the road, or the south shore. Try a variety of very small spinners and spoons. Nymphs and dry flies, such as mosquitoes, can work great when the wind is calm.\nEmergency Orders \nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nEmergency Order 2-KS-7-10-24: Anchor River and Deep Creek Closed to Sport Fishing\nEmergency Order 2-KS-7-07-24:Sport Fishing For King Salmon Closed in Upper Cook Inlet Salt Waters\nEmergency Order 2-KS-7-12-24:King Salmon Bag Limit Reduced from 2 to 1 in Lower Cook Inlet Salt Waters\nEmergency Order 2-KS-7-13-24:Changes to King Salmon Limits and Gear in the Ninilchik River\nPress Release:Cook Inlet Sport Fishing Regulation Changes\n\nDon't forget to purchase your 2024 sport fishing license and king stamp!

Fishing around slack tide is the best time for targeting halibut so you can hold the bottom with less weight. Herring on a circle hook is the most popular bait; however, octopus, salmon heads, and jigs also work well.\nKing Salmon\nKing salmon fishing south of Bluff Point has been hit or miss, with scattered reports from the Bluff area as well as throughout inner Kachemak Bay.

To find king salmon at any location, try setting the gear at different depths including mid-water column and 10 feet off the bottom.\nSurf Fishing\nSurf fishing anglers were finding success on several of the Cook Inlet beaches last weekend. Popular locations for halibut include Kasilof, Clam Gulch, Ninilchik boat harbor, Deep Creek campground, and Whiskey Gulch. Anglers are catching a variety of groundfish including halibut, sculpins, skates, sharks, flounders, and cod.

Don’t forget about fishing off the tip of the Homer Spit – that location can be productive for a variety of groundfish.\nNick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon\nKing salmon are beginning to show up to the NDFL in very small numbers - expect slow fishing to continue throughout the week. Fishing the incoming or outgoing tide is typically your best bet – the tide should be flooding into the lagoon around the +11 ft height. Roe or a chunk of herring under a bobber and spinners are both effective methods for king salmon here.\nLocal Lakes\nThe Homer Reservoir (located on Skyline Drive) is a great place to take kids and catch a Dolly Varden.

You may not remove king salmon or steelhead from the water before releasing them.\nThe Ninilchik River is open to fishing for hatchery king salmon through July 15. The fishing should be fair and should improve over the next week as the larger tides should bring more fish into the river. Bait is now prohibited so gear is limited to single-hook artificial lures. For targeting newly arriving fish, try fishing the harbor area on the incoming tide. With these low water conditions smaller (size 3 or 4) pink or chartreuse spinners could be effective. Flies, plugs, and spoons will work well too. If you incidentally hook a steelhead or wild king salmon, get them to the bank as quickly as possible and release them without removing them from the water.\nChina Poot personal use dipnet fishery opened on June 15. Water conditions are very high and there are very few sockeye salmon in the creek. The sockeye salmon run should improve later in the week.\n\nSaltwater Fishing \nKachemak Bay/Cook Inlet\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing remained productive for large fish over last week. Larger fish were coming from many locations including the kelp beds near Anchor Point, in Cook Inlet, and the outer coast near the Chugach Islands.

Herring on a circle hook is the most popular bait; however, octopus, salmon heads, and jigs also work well.\nKing Salmon\nKing salmon fishing south of Bluff Point was fair to good through last week with some days with good numbers of fish. Best success has been setting the gear in the mid-water column. Bluff Point and Point Pogibshi produced the best catches with spotty success throughout the rest of Kachemak Bay.

To find king salmon at any location, try setting the gear at different depths including mid-water column and 10 feet off the bottom.\nSockeye Salmon\nSockeye salmon fishing in China Poot and Tutka Bay Lagoon are off to a slow start since very few fish have shown up. The runs should improve over the week to provide a few fish to those looking to snag some fish.\nSurf Fishing\nPersistent surf fishing anglers were finding success on several of the Cook Inlet beaches last weekend, including the Deep Creek area. Anglers fishing the tip of the Homer Spit are catching a variety of groundfish including halibut, sculpins, skates, sharks, flounders, and cod.

Anglers were most successful closer to high tide in the southern lobe of the lagoon. A chunk of herring about 2 feet under a bobber has been working well this season. Casting spinners is another option worth trying.\nSeldovia Slough\nAnglers were finding slow success in the lagoon and at the bridge last week. Try cured eggs or herring under a slip bobber, or spinners. Incoming tide is the best time to get king salmon at the bridge. High tide is better in the lagoon.\nLocal Lakes\nThe Homer Reservoir (located on Skyline Drive) is a great place to take kids and catch a Dolly Varden. The fish are small, but can be voracious.

Casting spinners is another option worth trying.\nSeldovia Slough\nAnglers were finding slow success in the lagoon and at the bridge last week. This fishery is now open to snagging for the rest of the season.\nLocal Lakes\nThe Homer Reservoir (located on Skyline Drive) is a great place to take kids and catch a Dolly Varden. The fish are small, but can be voracious. Dollies are often found along the shore by the road, or the south shore. Try a variety of very small spinners and spoons. Nymphs and dry flies, such as mosquitoes, can work great when the wind is calm.\nEmergency Orders \nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nEmergency Order 2-KS-7-23-24: Ninilchik River Gear Changes\nEmergency Order 2-KS-7-07-24:Sport Fishing For King Salmon Closed in Upper Cook Inlet Salt Waters\nEmergency Order 2-KS-7-12-24:King Salmon Bag Limit Reduced from 2 to 1 in Lower Cook Inlet Salt Waters\nPress Release:Cook Inlet Sport Fishing Regulation Changes\n\nDon't forget to purchase your 2024 sport fishing license and king stamp!

Dolly Varden are just starting to enter these streams in small numbers which should result in slow fishing this week. For fly fisherman, smolt patterns, streamers, and beads are the best options. Spinners and spoons are great options for fishing with spinning rods.\n\n\nThe Ninilchik River is still open to fishing for hatchery king salmon through July 15 but the run is winding down. For targeting newly arriving fish, try fishing the harbor area on the incoming tide. With these low water conditions smaller (size 3 or 4) pink or chartreuse spinners should be the most effective. Flies, plugs, and spoons will work well too. If you incidentally hook a wild king salmon, get them to the bank as quickly as possible and release them without removing them from the water.\n\n\nChina Poot personal use dipnet fishery has been producing limits of sockeye salmon for most making the trip across the bay. Water conditions are still high which makes spotting fish more difficult.\n\n\nSaltwater Fishing \nKachemak Bay/Cook Inlet\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing remained productive for large fish over last week. Larger fish were coming from many locations including Cook Inlet and the outer coast near the Chugach Islands. Flat Island has been consistent with good numbers of smaller fish. Fishing around slack tide is the best time for targeting halibut so you can hold the bottom with less weight. Herring on a circle hook is the most popular bait; however, octopus, salmon heads, and jigs also work well.\nKing Salmon\nKing salmon fishing south of Bluff Point was productive for anglers trolling over the weekend. Expect small numbers of king salmon scattered throughout Kachemak Bay. Small troll herring or spoons behind a flasher is the most popular setup, but hootchies and tube flies will also produce fish. To find king salmon at any location, try setting the gear at different depths including mid-water column and 10 feet off the bottom.\nLingcod\nLingcod fishing opened on July 1. Expect fair to good fishing over the next week when seas are favorable to make it out to the outer coast to fish along the coast from the Chugach Islands to Gore Point.\nSockeye Salmon\nSockeye salmon fishing in China Poot and Tutka Bay Lagoon was good over the last few days. Expect similar conditions over the week.\nSurf Fishing\nPersistent surf fishing anglers were finding success on several of the Cook Inlet beaches last weekend, including the Deep Creek area and the Homer Spit. Anglers are catching a variety of groundfish including halibut, sculpins, skates, sharks, flounders, and cod.\nNick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon\nKing salmon fishing has been poor at the fishing hole and the king salmon run should be nearing the end. Since there is no buildup of king salmon, the lagoon is not likely to open for snagging for king salmon. For targeting the few late arrivers, a chunk of herring about 2 feet under a bobber has been working well this season. Casting spinners is another option worth trying.\nRazor Clams\nThere are several days of minus tides this week that will provide opportunities to dig razor clams in West Cook Inlet. Both Crescent River Bar and Polly Creek have good numbers of large clams this season.\nLocal Lakes\nThe Homer Reservoir (located on Skyline Drive) is a great place to take kids and catch a Dolly Varden. The fish are small, but can be voracious. Dollies are often found along the shore by the road, or the south shore. Try a variety of very small spinners and spoons.

For fly fisherman, smolt patterns, streamers, and beads are the best options. Spinners and spoons are great options for fishing with spinning rods.\nCoho Salmon\nA few coho salmon are trickling in to the Anchor River, Deep Creek, and Ninilchik River, but expect fishing to be slow. Fishing the early morning near the mouth of the rivers near a high tide may produce some fresh fish. A small glob of cured salmon roe under a bobber, or herring under a bobber, are typically the most effective way to catch coho salmon. Fly anglers can also find success by swinging streamers. Spinners and plugs are also great methods.\nSockeye Salmon\nThere are plenty of sockeye salmon left in China Poot Creek for the last two weeks of the personal use season.

Sockeye are still abundant in the creek and most are still bright and fresh. Tutka Bay Lagoon was fair for snagging and pink salmon are starting to arrive. Expect similar conditions over this week.\nSurf Fishing\nSurf fishing at the tip of the Homer spit has provided anglers a variety of groundfish including halibut, sculpins, skates, sharks, flounders, and cod.\nNick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon\nThere’s a small school of coho salmon in the lagoon.

With a little prospecting in the upper sections of the streams, especially the Anchor River, fishing can be fair. Fishing with beads pegged under small strike indicators is one of the most effective ways to target dollies. For fly fisherman, smolt patterns, streamers, and beads are the best options. Spinners and spoons are great options for fishing with spinning rods.\nCoho Salmon\nCoho salmon have begun entering the Anchor River, Deep Creek, and Ninilchik River, but expect fishing to be slow. Fish should build through the end of the month. Fishing the early morning near the mouth of the rivers near a high tide may produce some fresh fish. A small glob of cured salmon roe under a bobber, or herring under a bobber, are typically the most effective way to catch coho salmon. Fly anglers can also find success by swinging streamers. Spinners and plugs are also great methods.\nSockeye Salmon\nThere are still sockeye left in China Poot Creek to wrap up the last few days of the personal use dipnet fishery. Some bright fish are present, but it will require a little bit of sorting. There may be a couple of pink salmon showing up so pay close attention that you are only keeping sockeye salmon.\nSaltwater Fishing \nKachemak Bay/Cook Inlet\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing has continued to be good when the marine weather has let up to allow trips into the Inlet. Small tides this week will make it easier to set the anchor and fish a productive spot. Herring on a circle hook is the most popular bait; however, octopus, salmon heads, and jigs also work well.\nKing Salmon\nKing salmon fishing south of Bluff Point was spotty over the last week, with reports of larger fish picked up in the bluff area and some fish caught near Yukon Island. Expect small numbers of king salmon scattered throughout Kachemak Bay. Small troll herring or spoons behind a flasher is the most popular setup, but hootchies and tube flies will also produce fish. To find king salmon at any location, try setting the gear at different depths including mid-water column and 10 feet off the bottom.\nCoho Salmon\nTrolling has not been productive for coho salmon yet.\nLingcod\nLingcod fishing has been good on the outer coast, including the Chugach Islands area, when the seas have allowed.\nSockeye Salmon\nSockeye in China Poot Bay are starting to taper off, but anglers can still find a limit with a little work. Expect pink salmon to also be present in Tutka Bay Lagoon.\nSurf Fishing\nSurf fishing at the tip of the Homer spit has provided anglers a variety of groundfish including halibut, sculpins, skates, sharks, flounders, and cod\nNick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon\nThere’s a small school of coho salmon in the lagoon. Fishing on the incoming and outgoing tide has had a short, but productive, bite. Drifting salmon roe clusters or small pieces of herring under a bobber is the most effective method. Try using a spinner after the current slows down on the incoming tide.\nLocal Lakes\nThe Homer Reservoir (located on Skyline Drive) is a great place to take catch Dolly Varden. The fish are small, but can be fun to catch. Dollies are often found along the shore by the road, or the south shore. Try a variety of very small spinners and spoons. Nymphs and dry flies, such as mosquitoes, can work great when the wind is calm.\nEmergency Orders \nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nEmergency Order 2-KS-7-07-24:Sport Fishing For King Salmon Closed in Upper Cook Inlet Salt Waters\nEmergency Order 2-KS-7-12-24:King Salmon Bag Limit Reduced from 2 to 1 in Lower Cook Inlet Salt Waters\nPress Release: Cook Inlet Sport Fishing Regulation Changes\n\nDon't forget to purchase your 2024 sport fishing license and king stamp!

Fishing was slow over the last weekend, but the number of king salmon holding in river may build over the week. Spinners and spoons are the best bet since the fishery is closed to the use of bait this season. If you incidentally hook a steelhead or wild king salmon, get them to the bank as quickly as possible and release them without removing them from the water.\nSaltwater Fishing\r\nKachemak Bay/Cook Inlet\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing continues to improve as more fish move into Cook Inlet from overwintering waters. For those looking for bigger fish, try the shallow water from Bluff Point to Anchor Point. Fishing around slack tide is the best time for targeting halibut so you can hold the bottom with less weight. Herring on a circle hook is the most popular bait; however, octopus, salmon heads, and jigs also work well.\nKing Salmon\nKing salmon fishing south of Bluff Point has been fair with scattered reports from the Bluff and 4th of July areas, as well as throughout inner Kachemak Bay. Small troll herring or spoons behind a flasher is the most popular setup, but hootchies and tube flies will also produce fish. To find king salmon at any location, try setting the gear at different depths including mid-water column and 10 feet off the bottom.\nSurf Fishing\nSurf fishing anglers were finding success on several of the Cook Inlet beaches last weekend. Anglers are catching a variety of groundfish including halibut, sculpins, skates, sharks, flounders, and cod. Don’t forget about fishing off the tip of the Homer Spit – that location can be productive for a variety of groundfish.\nNick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon\nThe king salmon run at the Nick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon is still slow, but some fish are starting to show up. Expect poor fishing throughout the week. Fishing the incoming or outgoing tide is typically your best bet – the tide should be flooding into the lagoon around the +11 ft height. Roe under a bobber, herring, and spinners are all effective methods for king salmon here.\nSeldovia Slough\nKing salmon fishing has gotten off to a slow start, but anglers were still finding some success fishing at the bridge. Try cured eggs or herring under a slip bobber, or spinners. Incoming tide is the best time to get king salmon at the bridge. High tide is better in the lagoon.\nEmergency Orders\n“Please review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\nAnchor River and Deep Creek Closed to Sport Fishing\nSport Fishing For King Salmon Closed in Upper Cook Inlet Salt Waters\nKing Salmon Bag Limit Reduced from 2 to 1 in Lower Cook Inlet Salt Waters\nChanges to King Salmon Gear in the Ninilchik River\nRockfish bag limit reduction: 2 pelagic, 1 non-pelagic.

A total of 558 king salmon were collected in the William Jack Hernandez Sport Fish Hatchery raceway. The hatchery was not able to meet the broodstock goal of 329 king salmon spawning pairs. During a foot survey on July 11, 2024, a peak count of 285 king salmon were counted in Ship Creek. The total escapement for Ship Creek is estimated at 659 king salmon.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\nOn June 29, 2024, king salmon fishing was closed in Ship Creek from its mouth upstream to a cable 100 feet downstream of the Chugach Power Plant dam.\nCampbell Creek\n\r\n      King salmon fishing is only open for a youth-only fishery in Campbell Creek during the last weekend in June. A survey was conducted on June 25, 2024, and no king salmon were observed from Old Seward Highway to the Dimond Blvd Bridge prior to the youth-only fishery. Surveys of Campbell Creek were conducted on July 22, 2024, and escapement was estimated at 160 king salmon; the sustainable escapement goal of 340 fish was not achieved.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\nOn June 27, 2024, king salmon fishing was restricted to no bait and catch and release only for the youth-only fishery occurring on June 29 and 30, 2024.\nPrince William Sound\n\r\n    King salmon fishing was slow to fair in Whittier and Cordova. Both locations are terminal harvest areas. Throughout the summer and fall, many anglers reported catching king salmon in Valdez Arm. There are no stockings in the Valdez vicinity. No formal surveys are conducted for king salmon in Prince William Sound.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\nNo management actions were implemented during the 2024 sport fishery season.\nNorth Gulf Coast/Resurrection Bay\n\r\n    King salmon fishing was fair to good in Resurrection Bay. Angler reports indicated that the king salmon fishing in Resurrection Bay was slow and that fish seemed to be returning later and in lower numbers.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n        On June 26, 2024, the youth-only fishery for king salmon in the Seward Lagoon and Outfall stream was extended through July 31, 2024, to allow additional harvest opportunity.\r\n        \nSockeye Salmon\nResurrection Bay\n\r\n      Anglers reported good sockeye salmon fishing in Resurrection Bay but a more condensed season. On June 18, 2024, 10,761 sockeye salmon passed through the Bear Creek weir, with fair numbers of sockeye salmon still entering the river at that time. Bear Lake sockeye salmon have a sustainable escapement goal (SEG) of 700 - 8,300 fish and is managed to escape 12,200 sockeye salmon, which meets both the SEG and the Trail Lakes Hatchery broodstock requirements. The final escapement (excluding broodstock) was approximately 12,564 sockeye salmon. \r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n          On June 21, 2024, in marine waters of Resurrection Bay north of a line from Caines Head to the north point of Thumb Cove and the freshwaters open to sockeye salmon fishing, the bag and possession limits for sockeye salmon were increased to twelve fish.\r\n        \nPrince William Sound\n\r\n      Sockeye salmon fishing in the Coghill River was reported as fair to good this season. The final weir count on July 27, 2024 was 90,196 sockeye salmon through the Coghill River weir. The sockeye salmon SEG for the Coghill River is 20,000 - 75,000 fish.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n        On July 3, 2024, the Coghill River drainage sockeye salmon bag limits were increased 12 fish and possession limit of 24 fish. In addition, the fishing area was increased to within 50 feet of the weir.\r\n      \nCoho Salmon\nShip Creek\n\r\n     Coho salmon fishing in Ship Creek this season was poor. The William Jack Hernandez Sport Fish Hatchery collected 740 coho salmon for broodstock and achieved the egg-take goals needed to replace Ship Creek coho salmon broodstock and for stocking terminal fisheries. Multiple surveys were conducted by Division of Sport Fish staff in Ship Creek this season to monitor coho salmon returns. High water made surveys difficult in early August.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n       On August 14, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to one fish in Ship Creek and only unbaited, artificial lures allowed from its mouth upstream to a cable 100 feet downstream of the Chugach Power Plant dam.\r\n    \n\r\n    Effective August 24 through September 30, 2024, coho salmon fishing was closed on Ship Creek.\nAnchorage Area Streams\n\r\n      Coho salmon fishing in Anchorage Area streams was poor. Peak stream surveys on Bird, Campbell, and Rabbit creek drainages indicated poor returns on coho salmon. Sport fishing reports were poor.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n      On August 14, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to one fish per day, and only unbaited, artificial lures allowed in all streams excluding Bird and Campbell creeks effective through September 30,2024.\r\n    \nNorth Gulf Coast and Resurrection Bay\n\r\n      Coho salmon fishing in the North Gulf Coast including Resurrection Bay was poor this season for both boat and shore anglers. While coho salmon returning to the Seward Lagoon arrived later in the season, fishing was still poor. Fishing at the mouth of Resurrection River was reportedly poor this season for coho salmon. As of October 17, 693 coho salmon have entered the Bear Creek weir, which will not provide adequate escapement for broodstock goals. Egg takes were conducted with only 60 female coho salmon at the Bear Creek. Escapement surveys were not conducted for coho salmon due to budget cuts. \r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n     On August 21, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to 1 per day and in possession in the North Gulf Coast fresh and salt waters (excluding Resurrection Bay).\r\n    \n\r\n      On August 21, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to 3 per day and in possession in Resurrection Bay Terminal Harvest Area.\r\n    \nPrince William Sound\n\r\n      Coho salmon fishing was poor throughout Prince William Sound. Coho salmon fishing at Fleming Spit was better than previous years but not nearly as good as observations in 2023. It has not been determined yet if broodstock goals have been met by the Valdez Fisheries Development Association (VFDA) and Prince William Sound Aquaculture Corporation hatcheries (PWSAC). Currently the VFDA in Valdez does not have enough coho salmon to meet their egg take goal and PWSAC also may not meet their egg take goals at the Wally Noerenberg hatchery. Egg takes for these locations have not yet occurred. Both Whittier and Cordova are stocked by PWSAC and are terminal harvest areas. In Valdez, coho salmon are stocked by VFDA. No formal surveys are conducted for coho salmon in Prince William Sound, except for on the Copper River Delta.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n        On August 19, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to 3 per day and 6 in possession in the Valdez Terminal Harvest Area.\r\n      \n\r\n        On August 24, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to 1 per day and in possession in the Prince William Sound Area, excluding the Terminal Harvest Areas.\r\n      \n\r\n        On September 13, 2024, the Valdez Terminal Harvest area was closed to fishing for coho salmon through October 31.\r\n      \nCopper River Delta\n\r\n      Coho salmon fishing on the Copper River Delta was good. Water conditions were variable throughout the season with some high-water events and some normal periods of low fishable water. As of early September, the Copper River Delta coho salmon return was anticipated to meet the SEG of 32,000 - 50,000 fish based on aerial survey counts. The coho salmon return is still being assessed.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n        No management actions were implemented during the 2024 sport fishery season.\r\n      \nShrimp\nPrince William Sound\n\r\n      The total allowable harvest (TAH) of 117,023 pounds was established from the results of the fall 2023 Prince William Sound shrimp survey. The 2024 guideline harvest level (GHL) for the noncommercial (sport and subsistence) shrimp fishery harvest was established to be 70,214 pounds. This was approximately 30% lower than the TAH and GHL established for the 2023 season. Approximately 4,143 noncommercial permits were issued in 2024. Effort and harvest are assessed post-season after harvest reports are received. Anecdotal reports from permit holders indicate that shrimping was fair to good this season.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n       A preseason emergency order effective April 15, 2024, reduced the number of allowable noncommercial shrimp pots per person and per vessel to two pots in areas near the ports of Valdez and Whittier, and three pots in outer areas of Prince William Sound.\r\n      \nRockfish\nPrince William Sound\n\r\n      The harvest of rockfish has increased and sustainable levels of rockfish harvest are currently unknown. Preliminary stock assessment work was reviewed in spring 2023 and changes in the biological data along with the increased harvest are indicators of a possible change in the population structure of rockfish in this area. In addition, harvest rates of yelloweye rockfish specifically appear to be unsustainable into the future and a seasonal restriction was put in place for the second year in a row to reduce harvest and protect these fish during the period of time that females are gravid and release larvae. The 2024 harvest information will not be finalized until the fall of 2025.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n        Effective April 1 â€“ June 30, 2024, no retention of yelloweye rockfish was allowed in the Prince William Sound Management Area.\r\n      \n\r\n        Effective April 1 â€“ December 31, the bag and possession limit for all rockfish was reduced to 3 per day and 6 in possession.\r\n      \nNorth Gulf Coast/Resurrection Bay\n\r\n       The harvest of rockfish has increased, and sustainable levels of rockfish harvest are currently unknown. Preliminary stock assessment work was reviewed in spring 2023 and changes in the biological data along with the increased harvest are indicators of a possible change in the population structure of rockfish in this area. The 2024 harvest information will not be finalized until the fall of 2025.\r\n      \nManagement Actions\n\r\n        Due to Board of Fisheries regulatory action, effective January 1 â€“ December 31, 2024, the bag and possession limit for rockfish was reduced to 3 per day and 6 in possession.\r\n      \nPDF of Summary, which includes tables of Escapement Goals and Escapements - including some prior years."

King salmon are managed to achieve an inriver return of 95,000 fish, to provide for a sustainable escapement goal (SEG) of 55,000 - 120,000 spawning salmon.\r\n    \n\r\n    Commercial, sport, and subsistence catch information indicated average run timing with a return that was well below the historical average. Approximately 4,340 king salmon were harvested during the sockeye salmon commercial fishery. Harvest estimates for the sport and subsistence fisheries are not currently available. Reports from creel staff, anglers, guides, and subsistence users suggest a low abundance with more difficulty in harvest in the sport fishery and subsistence fisheries.

A total of 558 king salmon were collected in the William Jack Hernandez Sport Fish Hatchery raceway. The hatchery was not able to meet the broodstock goal of 329 king salmon spawning pairs. During a foot survey on July 11, 2024, a peak count of 285 king salmon were counted in Ship Creek. The total escapement for Ship Creek is estimated at 659 king salmon.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\nOn June 29, 2024, king salmon fishing was closed in Ship Creek from its mouth upstream to a cable 100 feet downstream of the Chugach Power Plant dam.\nCampbell Creek\n\r\n      King salmon fishing is only open for a youth-only fishery in Campbell Creek during the last weekend in June. A survey was conducted on June 25, 2024, and no king salmon were observed from Old Seward Highway to the Dimond Blvd Bridge prior to the youth-only fishery. Surveys of Campbell Creek were conducted on July 22, 2024, and escapement was estimated at 160 king salmon; the sustainable escapement goal of 340 fish was not achieved.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\nOn June 27, 2024, king salmon fishing was restricted to no bait and catch and release only for the youth-only fishery occurring on June 29 and 30, 2024.\nPrince William Sound\n\r\n    King salmon fishing was slow to fair in Whittier and Cordova. Both locations are terminal harvest areas. Throughout the summer and fall, many anglers reported catching king salmon in Valdez Arm. There are no stockings in the Valdez vicinity. No formal surveys are conducted for king salmon in Prince William Sound.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\nNo management actions were implemented during the 2024 sport fishery season.\nNorth Gulf Coast/Resurrection Bay\n\r\n    King salmon fishing was fair to good in Resurrection Bay. Angler reports indicated that the king salmon fishing in Resurrection Bay was slow and that fish seemed to be returning later and in lower numbers.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n        On June 26, 2024, the youth-only fishery for king salmon in the Seward Lagoon and Outfall stream was extended through July 31, 2024, to allow additional harvest opportunity.\r\n        \nSockeye Salmon\nResurrection Bay\n\r\n      Anglers reported good sockeye salmon fishing in Resurrection Bay but a more condensed season. On June 18, 2024, 10,761 sockeye salmon passed through the Bear Creek weir, with fair numbers of sockeye salmon still entering the river at that time. Bear Lake sockeye salmon have a sustainable escapement goal (SEG) of 700 - 8,300 fish and is managed to escape 12,200 sockeye salmon, which meets both the SEG and the Trail Lakes Hatchery broodstock requirements. The final escapement (excluding broodstock) was approximately 12,564 sockeye salmon. \r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n          On June 21, 2024, in marine waters of Resurrection Bay north of a line from Caines Head to the north point of Thumb Cove and the freshwaters open to sockeye salmon fishing, the bag and possession limits for sockeye salmon were increased to twelve fish.\r\n        \nPrince William Sound\n\r\n      Sockeye salmon fishing in the Coghill River was reported as fair to good this season. The final weir count on July 27, 2024 was 90,196 sockeye salmon through the Coghill River weir. The sockeye salmon SEG for the Coghill River is 20,000 - 75,000 fish.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n        On July 3, 2024, the Coghill River drainage sockeye salmon bag limits were increased 12 fish and possession limit of 24 fish. In addition, the fishing area was increased to within 50 feet of the weir.\r\n      \nCoho Salmon\nShip Creek\n\r\n     Coho salmon fishing in Ship Creek this season was poor. The William Jack Hernandez Sport Fish Hatchery collected 740 coho salmon for broodstock and achieved the egg-take goals needed to replace Ship Creek coho salmon broodstock and for stocking terminal fisheries. Multiple surveys were conducted by Division of Sport Fish staff in Ship Creek this season to monitor coho salmon returns. High water made surveys difficult in early August.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n       On August 14, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to one fish in Ship Creek and only unbaited, artificial lures allowed from its mouth upstream to a cable 100 feet downstream of the Chugach Power Plant dam.\r\n    \n\r\n    Effective August 24 through September 30, 2024, coho salmon fishing was closed on Ship Creek.\nAnchorage Area Streams\n\r\n      Coho salmon fishing in Anchorage Area streams was poor. Peak stream surveys on Bird, Campbell, and Rabbit creek drainages indicated poor returns on coho salmon. Sport fishing reports were poor.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n      On August 14, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to one fish per day, and only unbaited, artificial lures allowed in all streams excluding Bird and Campbell creeks effective through September 30,2024.\r\n    \nNorth Gulf Coast and Resurrection Bay\n\r\n      Coho salmon fishing in the North Gulf Coast including Resurrection Bay was poor this season for both boat and shore anglers. While coho salmon returning to the Seward Lagoon arrived later in the season, fishing was still poor. Fishing at the mouth of Resurrection River was reportedly poor this season for coho salmon. As of October 17, 693 coho salmon have entered the Bear Creek weir, which will not provide adequate escapement for broodstock goals. Egg takes were conducted with only 60 female coho salmon at the Bear Creek. Escapement surveys were not conducted for coho salmon due to budget cuts. \r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n     On August 21, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to 1 per day and in possession in the North Gulf Coast fresh and salt waters (excluding Resurrection Bay).\r\n    \n\r\n      On August 21, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to 3 per day and in possession in Resurrection Bay Terminal Harvest Area.\r\n    \nPrince William Sound\n\r\n      Coho salmon fishing was poor throughout Prince William Sound. Coho salmon fishing at Fleming Spit was better than previous years but not nearly as good as observations in 2023. It has not been determined yet if broodstock goals have been met by the Valdez Fisheries Development Association (VFDA) and Prince William Sound Aquaculture Corporation hatcheries (PWSAC). Currently the VFDA in Valdez does not have enough coho salmon to meet their egg take goal and PWSAC also may not meet their egg take goals at the Wally Noerenberg hatchery. Egg takes for these locations have not yet occurred. Both Whittier and Cordova are stocked by PWSAC and are terminal harvest areas. In Valdez, coho salmon are stocked by VFDA. No formal surveys are conducted for coho salmon in Prince William Sound, except for on the Copper River Delta.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n        On August 19, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to 3 per day and 6 in possession in the Valdez Terminal Harvest Area.\r\n      \n\r\n        On August 24, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to 1 per day and in possession in the Prince William Sound Area, excluding the Terminal Harvest Areas.\r\n      \n\r\n        On September 13, 2024, the Valdez Terminal Harvest area was closed to fishing for coho salmon through October 31.\r\n      \nCopper River Delta\n\r\n      Coho salmon fishing on the Copper River Delta was good. Water conditions were variable throughout the season with some high-water events and some normal periods of low fishable water. As of early September, the Copper River Delta coho salmon return was anticipated to meet the SEG of 32,000 - 50,000 fish based on aerial survey counts. The coho salmon return is still being assessed.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n        No management actions were implemented during the 2024 sport fishery season.\r\n      \nShrimp\nPrince William Sound\n\r\n      The total allowable harvest (TAH) of 117,023 pounds was established from the results of the fall 2023 Prince William Sound shrimp survey. The 2024 guideline harvest level (GHL) for the noncommercial (sport and subsistence) shrimp fishery harvest was established to be 70,214 pounds. This was approximately 30% lower than the TAH and GHL established for the 2023 season. Approximately 4,143 noncommercial permits were issued in 2024. Effort and harvest are assessed post-season after harvest reports are received. Anecdotal reports from permit holders indicate that shrimping was fair to good this season.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n       A preseason emergency order effective April 15, 2024, reduced the number of allowable noncommercial shrimp pots per person and per vessel to two pots in areas near the ports of Valdez and Whittier, and three pots in outer areas of Prince William Sound.\r\n      \nRockfish\nPrince William Sound\n\r\n      The harvest of rockfish has increased and sustainable levels of rockfish harvest are currently unknown. Preliminary stock assessment work was reviewed in spring 2023 and changes in the biological data along with the increased harvest are indicators of a possible change in the population structure of rockfish in this area. In addition, harvest rates of yelloweye rockfish specifically appear to be unsustainable into the future and a seasonal restriction was put in place for the second year in a row to reduce harvest and protect these fish during the period of time that females are gravid and release larvae. The 2024 harvest information will not be finalized until the fall of 2025.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n        Effective April 1 â€“ June 30, 2024, no retention of yelloweye rockfish was allowed in the Prince William Sound Management Area.\r\n      \n\r\n        Effective April 1 â€“ December 31, the bag and possession limit for all rockfish was reduced to 3 per day and 6 in possession.\r\n      \nNorth Gulf Coast/Resurrection Bay\n\r\n       The harvest of rockfish has increased, and sustainable levels of rockfish harvest are currently unknown. Preliminary stock assessment work was reviewed in spring 2023 and changes in the biological data along with the increased harvest are indicators of a possible change in the population structure of rockfish in this area. The 2024 harvest information will not be finalized until the fall of 2025.\r\n      \nManagement Actions\n\r\n        Due to Board of Fisheries regulatory action, effective January 1 â€“ December 31, 2024, the bag and possession limit for rockfish was reduced to 3 per day and 6 in possession.\r\n      \nPDF of Summary, which includes tables of Escapement Goals and Escapements - including some prior years."

This year marks the fifth year of king salmon management under the four stock-based goals set for the Susitna River drainage (Deshka, Yentna, Eastside, and Talkeetna). The preseason forecast of total run for Deshka River king salmon was 6,671 fish. Given this forecast was below the low end of the BEG and that the escapement goal was missed in 2023, the Deshka king salmon fishery started the 2024 season closed, as did fisheries within the Talkeetna, Yentna, Little Susitna, and Eastside Susitna areas. King salmon escapement goals for all systems were missed in 2024.\r\n    \nWestside Susitna Tributaries\n\r\n    The BEG for the Deshka River of 9,000–18,000 king salmon was not achieved in 2024 despite the sport fishery remaining closed throughout the season. The final weir count was 3,440 king salmon. The age composition of the Deshka king salmon run and forecast for the 2024 season is pending analysis of age data collected at the Deshka River weir. A complete sonar count was conducted for Lake Creek and aerial escapement surveys were flown in late July on five streams contributing to the Yentna king salmon stock: Talachulitna River, Red Creek, Canyon Creek, Dickerson Creek, and Red Salmon Creek. Assessment of whether the Yentna OEG of 16,000–22,000 king salmon was achieved is pending data analysis; however, aerial counts were well below average, and the Lake Creek sonar count was similar to 2023.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n      A preseason emergency order effective May 1, 2024, closed king salmon fishing in the Susitna River drainage. Gear was restricted to only one unbaited, single hook, with a gap between the point and shank of the hook of one-half inch or less when fishing in Units 1–6 of the Susitna River drainage.\r\n      \nEastside Susitna and Talkeetna Tributaries\n\r\n    Assessment of Eastside Susitna streams (Units 2, 3, 5, and 6) comes from postseason aerial surveys over eight streams that are used to estimate run size and escapement of the Eastside (Unit 2 streams along the Parks Highway) king salmon stock and the Talkeetna River stock, which are two of the four Susitna River drainage stock goals in place since 2020. Counts were successfully conducted on Willow, North Fork, Kashwitna, and Montana Creeks, which collectively contribute to the Eastside king stock, and Clear and Prairie Creeks, which contribute to the Talkeetna stock. Assessment of the Eastside and Talkeetna stock goals is pending data analysis; however, counts on these systems were some of the lowest on record. A survey count of 272 on the Chulitna River was well below the SEG of 1,200–2,900 fish.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n      A preseason emergency order effective May 1, 2024, closed king salmon fishing on Eastside Susitna (Unit 2), the Talkeetna River (Unit 5), and the Chulitna River (Unit 6). Gear was restricted to only one unbaited, single-hook, artificial lure with a gap between the point and shank of the hook of one-half inch or less.\r\n      \nKnik Arm\n\r\n    The SEG for the Little Susitna River is 2,100–4,300 king salmon as assessed by weir and 700–1,500 fish as assessed by postseason aerial survey. This weir-based goal is the primary goal used for assessing escapement unless flooding or some other event results in an incomplete weir count. Use of video at this site has enabled fish to be counted even during periods of high spring runoff when water clarity is poor, which was the case throughout most of the 2024 season. Cold water temperatures likely impeded upstream migration of king salmon followed by flooding that occurred for 6 days mid-June, which made assessment of run strength using weir counts difficult. However, daily counts after recovery of the weir following the flooding were below past years in which the goal was achieved. The sport fishery was closed by preseason emergency order. The final weir count of 1,013 is considered incomplete.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n      A preseason emergency order effective May 1, 2024, closed king salmon fishing in the Little Susitna River drainage. In addition, only one unbaited, single-hook, artificial lure with a gap between the point and shank of the hook of one-half inch or less in the waters normally open to king salmon fishing.\r\n      \nWest Cook Inlet\n\r\n    Sport fisheries on the Chuitna, Theodore, Lewis, and the Beluga River drainages are closed by regulation. An aerial survey was conducted on the Chuitna River in which 402 king salmon were counted, well below the SEG of 1,000–1,500 fish. The 2024 surveys of the Theodore River and Coal Creek counted only 33 and 38 king salmon, respectively.\r\n    \n\r\n    A preseason emergency order effective May 1, 2024, closed king salmon fishing on all West Cook Inlet streams not already closed by regulation.\r\n    \nSockeye Salmon\nSusitna Tributaries\n\r\n    A weir was operated to count sockeye salmon escapement into Larson Lake, which drains into the Talkeetna River via Larson Creek (Susitna River drainage). Weirs on Chelatna Lake (Lake Creek) and Judd Lake (Talachulitna River) were not operated this year due to budget reductions. On Larson Creek, the sport fishery, which occurs at the confluence of Larsen Creek and the Talkeetna River, is relatively close to the weir, allowing for timely inseason management of the fishery. Water levels were favorable toward consistent daily fish passage and fishing success throughout the season. The Larson Creek SEG of 15,000–35,000 sockeye salmon was achieved with a final count of 16,133 fish within the SEG range.\r\n    \n\r\n    A Susitna River personal use dip net fishery was implemented by the Board of Fisheries in 2020 to take place on the lower Susitna River from a point located approximately one mile below the old Susitna Station, downstream to the Alexander Creek turnoff/tip of Bell Island. This fishery is remote and only accessible by boat or short field performance aircraft capable of landing on gravel bars. The fishery is part of the Upper Cook Inlet Personal Use Salmon Fishery management plan and occurs each Saturday and Wednesday between 6:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. from July 10 through July 31. This was the fourth year of this fishery. Fishing effort mostly mirrored last season with relatively low participation. Fishing success was reported as poor each period through the end of July.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\nNo management actions were implemented during the 2024 season.\nKnik Arm\n\r\n    A weir is operated on Fish Creek to assess escapement and as a tool to manage the personal use dip net fishery. The SEG for the Fish Creek is 15,000–45,000 sockeye salmon. By management plan, a personal use dip net fishery may be opened by emergency order between July 15 and July 31, if the escapement is projected to be above 35,000 fish. The dip net fishery was opened on July 20 for 11 days. Positive dipnetting reports combined with a strong run suggests the harvest estimate may be average to above average for 2024 (5-year mean harvest of 22,500 sockeye salmon). The weir was successfully operated throughout the run and 37,793 sockeye salmon were counted. Sport fishing was open for 7 days a week beginning this season, a change made at the last Board of Fisheries meeting.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n      On July 20, the Fish Creek Personal Use Dip Net Fishery was opened for all salmon species, except king salmon through July 31.\r\n      \nCoho Salmon\nSusitna Tributaries\n\r\n    Flooding prevented counting fish at the Deshka River weir during the season for six days beginning August 9, and the weir sustained major damage ending the weir project on August 16 after counting about 70% of the run based on historical run timing. The count of 642 coho salmon is considered incomplete, but it is unlikely the SEG of 10,200–24,100 fish would have been achieved. An emergency order was issued in August to close the Deshka River to the retention of coho salmon and prohibit the use of bait in all other waters of the Susitna River drainage.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n      On August 6, the bag limit for coho salmon was reduced to one fish and bait was prohibited in the Susitna River drainage.\r\n      \n\r\n      On August 15, the Susitna drainage was closed to fishing for coho salmon.\r\n      \nKnik Arm\n\r\n    The Little Susitna weir was inundated by flood waters at the beginning of the season from spring snow melt. However, when the weir became functional again starting June 22, it is unlikely any coho salmon were missed. Initially, weir counts were favorable and produced an upward trending projection; however counts drastically trailed off by the first quartile of the run on August 6. At this time, an emergency order was issued prohibiting the use of bait, followed by closure of the sport fishery to the retention of coho salmon. Beginning August 8, heavy rainfall led to high water events and a lost weir counts for eighteen days. Also, . The weir count of 964 fish is considered incomplete; however, it is likely the SEG of 9,200–17,700 was missed in 2024.\r\n    \n\r\n    Fish Creek weir operated for the full coho salmon season. The SEG of 1,200–6,000 fish was not attained with a final count of 235 fish. This count was complete. \r\n    \n\r\n    Jim Creek weir was funded to operate this season. A weak showing of coho salmon prompted closing the sport fishery to coho salmon fishing by mid-August at about the quarter point of the historical run timing for coho salmon. In addition to Jim Creek, Cottonwood, Fish and Wasilla Creeks were all closed to sport fishing for coho on August 15. Weir counts up to this point were tracking well below years when the weir was operated and the goal was achieved and similar to the count by this time during 2016 when the SEG was missed. The SEG for Jim Creek of 250–700 coho salmon is assessed postseason by a foot survey of McRoberts Creek, a small spawning tributary within the Jim Creek system. A survey conducted on September 23 counted 376 coho salmon, which was within the goal range.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n      On August 6, bait use was prohibited on the Little Susitna River and Jim Creek drainage.\r\n      \n\r\n      On August 6, the bag and possession limit was reduced to one coho salmon on the Little Susitna River, and Jim Creek.\r\n      \n\r\n      On August 15, the Little Susitna River was closed to coho salmon fishing.\r\n      \n\r\n      On August 15, Jim Creek, Cottonwood Creek, Wasilla Creek and Fish Creeks were closed to coho fishing.\r\n      \nWest Cook Inlet\n\r\n    Coho salmon escapement is not monitored on West Cook Inlet (WCI) area streams and ADF&G must rely on trends in harvest and angler effort taken from the Statewide Harvest Survey and reports from anglers and guides when assessing these stocks. Sport fishing success was reportedly poor for the 2024 season.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n      On August 24, West Cook Inlet streams were restricted to two per day and four in possession for coho salmon.\r\n      \nSee the printable PDF version, which includes a table of Region II Escapement Goals and Escapements - including some prior years."

The 2024 forecasted total run was less than the optimal escapement goal (OEG) of 3,900–6,600 large fish, which resulted in preseason closures to the sport fishery. The total estimated passage through June 30, 2024, at the river mile 14 sonar was 1,365 large king salmon, and because of the fishery closure, preliminary spawning escapement and total run estimates are both 1,365 large early-run king salmon. The run exhibited generally low abundance across all age classes and is the second lowest run in the historical data set. The mid-point of the run occurred on June 14, which is two days late when compared to the historical mid-point. \r\n    \n\r\n    Preliminary age composition estimates from length groups show a noticeably low presence of ocean-age-four fish but overall, there was a low abundance of all age classes. \r\n    \n\r\n    Neither the OEG of 3,900–6,600 large fish nor the sustainable escapement goal (SEG) of 2,800–5,600 large fish were achieved in 2024. However, the SEG has been achieved or exceeded in four of the last seven years, and the OEG has been achieved or exceeded in three of the last seven years.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n    A preseason emergency order effective May 1, 2024, closed king salmon fishing from the Kenai River mouth upstream to the outlet of Skilak Lake until June 30. \r\n    \nRiver mile 8.6 netting assessment (preliminary)\n\r\n    Approximately 34% were large fish or ≥75 cm in total length.\r\n    \n\r\n    Sex ratio of large fish ≥75 cm was 26% male and 74% female.\r\n    \n\r\n    Sampled king salmon of all sizes were predominately ocean-age 2 fish (49%), followed by ocean-age 3 fish (31%), ocean-age 1 (14%), and ocean-age 4 fish (6%). \r\n    \nKenai River - Late Run\n\r\n    The outlook for late-run Kenai River king salmon in 2024 was well below average, with a large king salmon (>75 cm mid eye to tail fork length) forecast of approximately 13,639 fish. The 2024 forecasted total run was less than the optimal escapement goal (OEG) of 15,000–30,000 fish so the fishery started closed. The total estimated passage through August 19, 2024, at the river mile 14 sonar was 6,984 large king salmon, and the preliminary escapement is 6,959 large fish (accounts for spawning downriver of the sonar). The mid-point of the run occurred on July 29, which is two days later than the mean historical mid-point.\r\n    \n\r\n    The predominate age class for all sizes of Kenai River late-run king salmon are ocean-age 2 (39.5%), followed by ocean-age 3 (29.8%), ocean-age 4 fish (20.2%), and ocean-age 1 (10.5%). The low abundance of large fish age classes (ocean ages 3 and 4) indicates poor production from the 2017, 2018, and 2019 parent years and corresponds with the overall low abundance of the 2024 return.\r\n    \n\r\n    The OEG of 15,000–30,000 large fish and SEG of 13,500–27,000 large fish were not achieved in 2024. The SEG has been achieved in one of the last seven years and the OEG has not been achieved since it was created in 2020. Additionally, Kenai River late-run king salmon were designated a Stock of Concern at the Alaska Board of Fisheries March 2024 meeting. The action plan developed to recover Kenai River late-run king salmon includes a recovery goal of 14,250–30,000 large king salmon that is the department’s management objective until the stock recovers. The recovery goal was not achieved in 2024.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n    A preseason emergency order effective July 1, 2024, closed king salmon fishing from the Kenai River mouth upstream to the outlet of Skilak Lake.\r\n    \n\r\n    On August 12, 2024 multiple hooks were prohibited from the mouth of the Kenai River upstream to the Moose River confluence to reduce incidental catches of king salmon while fishing for other species.\r\n    \n\r\n    On August 16, 2023 the prohibition of bait and multiple hooks was extended from the mouth of the Kenai River \r\n    upstream to the outlet of Skilak Lake to reduce incidental catches of king salmon while fishing for other species.\r\n    \nRiver mile 8.6 netting assessment (preliminary)\r\n    Approximately 46% of king salmon were >75 cm in total length.\nSex ratios for large fish >75 cm was 77% male and 23% female. \n\nTable 1.

The naturally-produced (non-adipose finclipped) component of the Crooked Creek early-run king salmon run is managed to achieve a SEG of 700–1,400 king salmon. The estimated escapement of naturally-produced king salmon was 550 fish for the 2024 season. The egg take goal for future stocking of Crooked Creek was 25 pairs of naturally-produced king salmon of which 20 pairs were spawned in 2024.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n    A preseason emergency order effective May 1, 2024, prohibited the retention of naturally-produced king salmon and the use of multiple hooks.\r\n    \n\r\n    A pre-season emergency order effective May 1, 2024, restricted the use of bait until May 16, 2024.\r\n    \nJune 19, 2024, an emergency order was issued to restrict gear to single hook, artificial lure, or fly from the Kasilof River’s mouth to the outlet of Tustumena Lake. The emergency order also reduced the bag limit of hatchery-produced king salmon to one from July 1, 2024 to July 31, 2024.\nJuly 11, 2024, an emergency order was issued to close the king salmon fishery on the Kasilof River downstream of the Sterling Highway bridge effective July 15, 2024.\nJuly, 31, 2024, an emergency order was issued prohibiting the use of bait and restricting to single-hook, artificial lure or fly from the river’s mouth to the outlet of Tustumena lake.\nSockeye Salmon\nKenai River\n\r\n     The 2024 Upper Cook Inlet (UCI) sockeye salmon forecast projected a total run of 5.72 million fish: 3.38 million fish to the Kenai River, 1.12 million fish to the Kasilof River, with the remaining fish comprising stocks from Susitna River, Fish Creek, and unmonitored systems. Based on the preseason forecast, the sockeye salmon run was managed on the middle tier for runs of 2.3–4.6 million Kenai River sockeye salmon, with an inriver goal of 1.1–1.4 million sockeye salmon. On July 27, 2024, ADF&G projected the total Kenai River sockeye salmon run to be 2.96 million fish and the department continued to manage for the middle tier with an inriver goal of 1.1–1.4 million sockeye salmon. The preliminary inriver sonar passage estimate was 1,926,350 sockeye salmon. Subtracting the recent 10-year average harvest upstream of the sonar (387,757 fish) produces a preliminary escapement estimate of 1,538,593 sockeye salmon, which exceeds the sockeye salmon SEG 750,000–1.30 million fish. Final estimates will be available when the 2024 Statewide Harvest Survey is completed in the fall of 2025.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n      General regulations adopted a bag limit of 6 fish per day, 12 fish in possession for sockeye salmon from June 20 to August 15, 2024.\r\n      \nRussian River - Early Run\n\r\n   The escapement goal for Russian River early-run sockeye salmon is a biological escapement goal (BEG) of 22,000–42,000 fish. The weir count on July 14, 2024, was 34,697 sockeye salmon.\r\n   \nManagement Actions\n\r\n    On June 1, 2024, the Russian River Sanctuary Area opened early for sport fishing.\r\n    \nRussian River - Late Run\n\r\n    The escapement goal for Russian River late-run sockeye salmon is an SEG of 44,000–85,000 fish. The final Russian River weir count on September 3, 2024, was 70,009 sockeye salmon.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n   \tNo in season management actions were taken during the Russian River sockeye salmon late run 2024.\r\n    \nKasilof River\n\r\n   The forecast for Kasilof River sockeye salmon was 1,115,161 fish. Kasilof River sockeye salmon are managed to achieve an OEG of 140,000–370,000 fish. The sockeye salmon sonar enumerated salmon passage through August 22, 2024, with a preliminary estimate of 1,048,092 fish.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n   \tOn June 25, 2024, sockeye salmon limits were increased in all portions of the Kasilof River open to salmon fishing to six per day, twelve in possession.\r\n    \nCoho Salmon\nKenai River\n\r\n    Kenai River coho salmon are not monitored for abundance in season and are managed through angler reporting, observations, and conservative general regulation. Angler reports indicated that coho salmon were entering the river in the beginning of August but the abundance seemed poor based on success rates. September reports indicated a mix of angler success but generally, the abundance seemed to remain low in the Kenai River.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n    On August 21, 2024, an emergency order was issued to reduce the limit for coho salmon in the Kenai River to a bag and possession limit of one fish, effective Saturday, August 24, through Saturday, August 31, 2024; and a bag and possession limit of two coho salmon Sunday, September 1 through Saturday, November 30, 2024.\r\n    \n\r\n    On September 17, 2024, an emergency order was issued to reduce the bag and possession limit for coho salmon 16 inches or greater in length in the Kenai River to one fish; and restrict gear to one unbaited, single hook, artificial lure in the Kenai River from its mouth upstream to the regulatory marker at the outlet of Skilak Lake.\r\n    \nPersonal Use Dipnet Fisheries\nKasilof River and Kenai River\n\r\n  Harvest and participation information for the 2024 season are currently being compiled and will be available this coming winter. The Kasilof River set gill net personal use fishery was delayed by emergency order to reduce mortality of Kenai River bound king salmon from June 11, 2024 to June 19, 2024. The Kasilof River dipnet fishery was open by regulation from June 25 through August 7, 2024. The area open to dipnetting was expanded for the Kasilof fishery on June 25. The Kenai River dipnet fishery opened by regulation on July 10 through July 31, with no retention of king salmon allowed by regulation.\r\n  \nHarvest Reports\n\r\n  Beginning in 2024 harvest reporting was required to be submitted online by August 31, 2024\r\n  \nManagement Actions\n\r\n  On June 11, 2024, the Kasilof River personal use set gillnet fishery was closed until June 19, 2024.\r\n  \n\r\n  On June 25, 2024, the Kasilof River personal use dipnetting area was expanded. Dipnetting from shore was allowed from ADF&G markers located on Cook Inlet beaches upstream to ADF&G markers at approximately river mile four of the Kasilof River.\r\n  \n\r\n  On July 16, 2024, The Kenai River Personal Use Dip Net fishery was opened 24 hours per day until the season closure.\r\n  \nSee the printable PDF version, which includes a table of Region II Escapement Goals and Escapements - including some prior years."

The mid-point of the run occurred on June 21, which is similar to historical run timing. The Ayakulik River king salmon run has seen declines since 2006 and was designated as a stock of concern by the Board of Fisheries in 2020. The escapement objectives have been met some years; however, in the most recent years the escapement objectives have not been met and the 2024 weir count was the lowest in recent history.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n    AA preseason emergency order effective April 1, closed king salmon fishing on the Ayakulik River drainage and only one unbaited, single-hook artificial lure was allowed.\r\n    \n\nTable 1.

The Karluk River king salmon escapement has been below the BEG most of the last 20 years, though the goal was achieved from 2018-2020. The mid-point of the run occurred on June 18, which is similar to historical run-timing. The 2024 weir count was the lowest on record and one of the lowest king salmon returns in the State. The Karluk River has not been open to the harvest of king salmon since 2007 and sport fishing for king salmon has been entirely closed since 2008. \r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n    A preseason emergency order effective April 1, closed the Karluk River drainage to sport fishing for king salmon and only one unbaited, single-hook artificial lure was allowed.  \r\n    \n\nTable 2.

The mid-point of the run occurred on July 20, which is similar to historical run timing. While the Chignik River king salmon run has not seen as prolonged declines as Kodiak Island runs, it fell below the BEG 6 of the last 7 years.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n    A preseason emergency order was issued effective June 1 to close the Chignik River downstream to Mensis Point for sport fishing for king salmon and restrict tackle to only one unbaited, single-hook artificial lure. On June 13, the area closed in the Chignik River to king salmon fishing and bait and tackle restrictions was expanded to include the entire Chignik Lagoon.\r\n    \n\nTable 3.

The stocked Kodiak road system streams had low returns again in 2024 and there was little harvest in this fishery. Very few fish were observed at the Olds or at Salonie Creek and no fish at American River. Egg take goals were not met this year with only 5 spawning pairs collected. To compensate for this shortfall, coho salmon will be stocked to supplement king salmon production. The 2024 king salmon egg take should produce about 20,000 smolt and is well below the target of 200,000 king salmon smolt. Coho salmon will be taken again from Pillar Creek in early November to supplement this shortfall.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n    In 2024 the upper portions of the Olds River and Salonie Creek were closed byemergency order effective July 11 to all sport fishing to accommodate brood stockcollection for the egg take.\r\n    \nSockeye Salmon\nKarluk River\n\r\n    The early sockeye salmon escapement below the BEG of 150,000 - 250,000 fish with a weir count of 67,743 sockeye salmon. Little harvest occurs upstream of the weir and escapement is likely equal to the weir count.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\nNo management actions were implemented during the 2024 sport fishery season.\nAyakulik River\n\r\n    The early sockeye salmon escapement fell within the BEG of 140,000 - 280,000 fish with a weir count of 221,701 sockeye salmon. An unknown amount of harvest of sockeye salmon occurs above the weir, though it is minimal compared to the size of the run.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\nNo management actions were implemented during the 2024 sport fishery season.\nDog Salmon (Frazer) River\n\r\n    The sockeye salmon escapement was within the BEG of 75,000 - 170,000 fish with a count of 78,504 sockeye salmon at the Frazer Lake fish pass.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n    No management actions were implemented during the 2024 sport fishery season.\r\n    \nBuskin River\n\r\n    The sockeye salmon escapement was above the BEG of 5,000 - 8,000 fish with a weir count of 9,704 sockeye salmon. No harvest occurs upstream of the weir which is located just downstream from Buskin Lake and escapement is equal to the weir count. The mid-point of the run occurred on June 29, which is later than historical run-timing.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n    On July 3, the bag limit for sockeye salmon was increased to 5 per day by emergency order.\r\n    \nSaltery Cove\n\r\n    The sockeye salmon escapement was above the BEG of 15,000 - 35,000 fish with a weir count of 66,110 sockeye salmon. No harvest occurs upstream of the weir and escapement is equal to the weir count. The mid-point of the run occurred on July 24, which is later than historical run timing but similar to the last 5 years. This is the largest freshwater sport fishery on Kodiak by harvest for a single stock and the sockeye salmon run has been above the BEG most of the last 10 years. The 2024 run was still ongoing at the time the weir was pulled in mid-August.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n    On July 11, the sockeye salmon bag and possession limits were increased to 10 fish inthe Saltery Cove Drainage by emergency order.\r\n    \nPasagshak River\n\r\n    The sockeye salmon escapement was within the sustainable escapement goal (SEG) of 2,000 to 10,000 fish with a weir count of 7,641 sockeye salmon. No harvest occurs upstream of the weir and escapement is equal to the weir count. The mid-point of the run occurred on July 24, which is later than historical run timing but similar to the previous 5 years. This is the first season using the weir-based SEG versus the aerial survey based SEG and bag limits were able to be liberalized due correspondingly.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n    On July 11, the sockeye salmon bag limit was increased to 4 fish per day by emergency order.\r\n    \n\r\n    On July 27, the Pasagshak River drainage was reopened to sport fishing for sockeye salmon and bag \r\n    limits were restored.\r\n    \nAfognak (Litnik) River\n\r\n    The sockeye salmon escapement was within the BEG of 20,000 - 50,000 fish with a weir count of 32,218 sockeye salmon. The mid-point of the run occurred on June 21 which is later than historical run timing but similar to recent years.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\nNo management actions were implemented during the 2024 sport fishery season.\nCoho Salmon\nBuskin River - Preliminary Summary\n\r\n    The SEG for Buskin River coho salmon is 4,700 - 9,600 fish and the 2024 weir count was 2,238. The mid-point of the run typically occurs in the third week of September, however, the last 5 years have seen much of the Kodiak Road Zone coho salmon escapement in October and it is unknown at this date if the weir count is a complete count. Estimates will continue to be made into October as information is gathered.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n    No management actions were implemented during the 2024 sport fishery.\r\n    \nOlds River - Preliminary Summary\n\r\n    The lower bound SEG for Olds River coho salmon is 500 fish and the 2024 run is ongoing. The 2024 run appears to be average so far, though no surveys have been conducted to date. The Olds River coho salmon run is assessed via in season drone surveys, though conditions were poor to get reliable survey estimates. Final escapement estimates will be documented via post season foot surveys in late October or November.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\nNo management actions have been implemented during the 2024 sport fishery season so far.\nAmerican River - Preliminary Summary\n\r\n    The lower bound SEG for American River coho salmon is 400 fish and the 2024 run is weak so far. Foot and drone surveys conducted in late September showed no more than 30 fish in the drainage and the run does not appear it will achieve the SEG. Final escapement estimates will be documented via post season foot surveys in late October or November.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\nThe American River was closed to coho salmon fishing and the use of bait restricted byemergency order on September 25.\nPasagshak River - Preliminary Summary\n\r\n    The lower bound SEG for Pasagshak River coho salmon is 1,200 fish and the 2024 run is ongoing. The 2024 run appears to be average. The latest drone survey counted 2,326 coho salmon in Lake Rose Teed. The Pasagshak River coho salmon run is assessed via in season drone surveys but final escapement estimates will be documented via post season foot surveys in November.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\nNo management actions have been implemented during the 2024 sport fishery season.\nPDF of Summary, which includes tables of Escapement Goals and Escapements - including some prior years."

    "full_text": "Lower Cook Inlet Sport Fish Management Area\nPDF of Summary, which includes tables of Escapement Goals and Escapements - including some prior years.\nKing Salmon\nAnchor River\n\r\n    The Anchor River king salmon sustainable escapement goal (SEG) was updated to 3,200–6,400 fish starting in 2024. Additionally, the Alaska Board of Fisheries (BOF) adopted a management plan for the king salmon sport fisheries in the lower Kenai Peninsula roadside streams. This plan outlines preseason and inseason management actions for the Anchor River based on the preseason forecast and inseason projections.\r\n    \nThe 2024 preseason inriver forecast of 2,349 king salmon was below the SEG. With this forecast, the inriver sport fishery was closed preseason based on the management plan. King salmon escapement monitoring transitioned to a new location approximately one mile upstream of the river mouth. This location is just above the intertidal section of the stream and provides for more timely monitoring. Based on inseason projections, it was anticipated that the king salmon run was going to achieve the SEG and the sport fishery was opened on June 15 to catch-and-release fishing for the last four days of the season. The preliminary escapement estimate was 3,331 fish, which met the SEG. The mid-point (June 20) was 14 days early compared to the recent 3-year average mid-point of July 3. The Anchor River king salmon run has met its SEG in two (2021 and 2024) of the last five years.\nManagement Actions\n\r\n    A preseason emergency order closed the Anchor River and Deep Creek to all sport fishing through July 15.\r\n    \nAn inseason emergency order opened the Anchor River to catch and release king salmon fishing on June 15 for the remaining four days of the season. Gear was restricted to single-hook artificial lure.\nNinilchik River\n\r\n   The Ninilchik River king salmon sustainable escapement goal (SEG) was updated to 900–1,600 wild (naturally-produced) fish starting in 2024 based on counts at the lower (river mile 2) weir. Additionally, the Ninilchik River king salmon run is supplemented with hatchery fish. In 2023, the BOF adopted a management plan for the king salmon sport fisheries in the lower Kenai Peninsula roadside streams. This plan outlines preseason management actions for the Ninilchik River, based on the Anchor River forecast, and inseason management actions, based on the Ninilchik River wild and hatchery inseason projections. The BOF also restructured the king salmon sport fishery to be hatchery only by closing the harvest of wild king salmon in regulation, increasing the hatchery bag limit from 1 to 2 fish 20 inches or greater, and restricting gear to single hook with bait or single hook lures. Additionally, the area for the youth-only king salmon fishery was expanded to include an additional mile of stream upstream of the Sterling Highway bridge.\r\n   \n\r\n   No preseason forecast was estimated for the 2024 wild Ninilchik River king salmon run. The three 3-day weekend fishery occurred as outlined in the management plan. Effort and success generally increased over the weekends. The youth-only fishery was well attended and many youth anglers caught king salmon. At the start of the continuous fishery on June 16, the catch rates declined, which corresponded with a reduction in the daily passage of king salmon at the lower weir. With this, an emergency order was issued on June 19 to restrict the use of bait for the remainder of king salmon season. Effort tapered off through the remainder of June and success was poor to fair.\r\n   \n\r\n   The 2024 Ninilchik River wild king salmon escapement was 676 (after broodstock removals), which was below the lower end of the SEG and was the third consecutive year that the run did not achieve the SEG. The hatchery king salmon count upstream of the sport fishery was 1,298 fish, and after removals for broodstock, the hatchery escapement was 896 fish.\r\n   \nBroodstock collection at the Ninilchik River fell short of both the naturally-produced and hatchery-reared collection goals. Enough naturally-produced fish were collected to continue stocking the Ninilchik River in 2025 at a reduced level. The hatchery-reared collections also fell short at the other broodstock collection locations in Cook Inlet, so reduced numbers of smolt will be available for stocking at locations like Seldovia and the Homer Spit in 2025.\nManagement Actions\n\r\n    A preseason emergency order restricted the harvest of wild fish and increased the bag and possession limits of hatchery king salmon, 20 inches or greater in length, from one to two fish. The use of multiple hooks and treble hooks was also prohibited.\r\n    \nAn inseason emergency order was issued to restrict the use of bait in the continuous fishery from June 19 through July 15.\nDeep Creek\n\r\n    The sport fishery was closed with preseason restrictions based on management actions outlined in the management plan based on the Anchor River management actions. Deep Creek has a SEG of 350 king salmon and is assessed postseason via a single aerial survey. No survey was conducted in 2024 due to a lack of funding. \r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n    A preseason emergency order closed the Anchor River and Deep Creek to all sport fishing through July 15.\r\n    \nMarine Fisheries\n\r\n    Sport fishing for king salmon in Cook Inlet is structured into the Winter (September 1–March 31) and the Summer (April 1–August 31) Fisheries. The Summer Fishery is separated into two fisheries with the Lower Cook Inlet fishery occurring south of the Bluff Point latitude (lat 59°40.00′ N) and the Upper Cook Inlet (UCI) fishery occurring north. The BOF added some preseason and inseason management actions to the Upper Cook Inlet Summer Fishery management plan based on forecasts and inseason projections for early-run stocks (Deshka, Kenai, and Anchor Rivers). For early-run stocks, the effective dates for the management actions are May 1 through July 15. The BOF also included this fishery into the Kenai River Late Run King Salmon Recovery Plan. In the recovery plan, the Upper Cook Inlet Summer Fishery is closed in regulation from June 20 through August 15. With these changes and the restrictions and closures to freshwater sport fisheries throughout Cook Inlet drainages, sport fishing for king salmon was closed in UCI from May 1 through August 15. For the Lower Cook Inlet (LCI) Summer Fishery, the BOF adopted a management plan and established a Guideline Harvest Level (GHL) of 8,500 fish. No management actions were outlined in the plan. The bag limit was reduced from two to one king salmon any size in LCI from May through August 15, based on the closure in UCI and freshwater restrictions.\r\n    \n\r\n    The performance of these fisheries is only assessed postseason with the Statewide Harvest Survey and charter logbook data, and harvest estimates for 2024 will not be available until 2025. For 2023, the SWHS estimates of king salmon harvest for the Summer and Winter Fisheries were all below their respective averages for the past three years. The winter fishery harvest was 3,936 king salmon, which was below the guideline harvest level for the first time since 2013. In 2024, during the winter fishery, anglers found good success in January, but fishing success was lower in February and March. The summer fisheries had poor success from April through mid-May but improved in June and remained fair to good for the remainder of the summer. Anglers consistently found success in the Bluff Point area. At the start of the winter fishery season in September, anglers had good catches throughout Kachemak Bay.\nManagement Actions\n\r\n    A preseason emergency order effective May 1 closed king salmon fishing in the Cook Inlet salt waters north of the latitude of Bluff Point (lat 59°40.00′ N) through August 15.\r\n    \n\r\n    A preseason emergency order effective May 1 reduced the king salmon bag and possession limits from two to one fish any size in the Cook Inlet salt waters south of the latitude of Bluff Point (lat 59°40.00′ N) through July 31.\r\n    \nCoho Salmon\nFreshwater Fisheries\n\r\n    There are no preseason forecasts and no escapement goals for any coho salmon stocks in the lower Kenai Peninsula roadside streams (Anchor and Ninilchik Rivers, Deep and Stariski Creeks). A video weir was operated on the Anchor River to enumerate coho salmon escapement. The preliminary escapement count was 2,100 fish, which was well below the historical average. Based on below-average inseason counts and fishery performance indicators, most freshwater sport fisheries on the Kenai Peninsula and West Cook Inlet area were restricted. For the lower Kenai Peninsula roadside streams, the coho salmon bag limit was reduced from two to one fish and the use of bait and treble hooks was prohibited starting August 24 and continuing for the remainder of the season.\r\n    \n\r\n    Sport fishing effort was low throughout August on all lower Kenai Peninsula roadside streams and was further reduced towards the end of August with the emergency order restrictions. The Statewide Harvest Survey estimates of harvest for these fisheries will not be available until 2025.\r\n    \nMarine Fisheries\n\r\n    Sport fishing for coho salmon in Cook Inlet was poor, and anglers struggled to find concentrations of coho salmon. Most charters reported king salmon were more prevalent than coho salmon throughout July and August. Based on these fisheries performance indicators and the below average coho salmon run to the Anchor River, the coho salmon bag limit was restricted from three to one fish on August 24 through the remainder of the season for Cook Inlet salt waters, excluding the Nick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon. The Statewide Harvest Survey estimates for this fishery will not be available until 2025.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n    Coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced by emergency order in Kenai Peninsula fresh waters, West Cook Inlet fresh waters, and Cook Inlet salt waters. Additionally, the use of bait and treble hooks was prohibited in Kenai Peninsula fresh waters. The effective date for these restrictions was from August 24 through the remainder of the season.\r\n    \nTerminal StockedSalmon Fisheries\nNick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon\n \r\n    In 2024, the stocking goals were met for Nick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon (NDFL) on the Homer Spit with approximately 315,000 king salmon smolt and 120,000 coho salmon smolt. The Statewide Harvest Survey estimates harvest for these fisheries will not be available until 2025. Overall, the king and coho salmon fisheries were likely below recent average harvests in 2024. Snagging was not opened for either species in 2024 because there was not a sufficient buildup of fish at the end of the run.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n    No management actions occurred in 2024.\r\n    \nSeldovia Slough and Lagoon\nThe BOF made a couple of regulation changes for the Seldovia king salmon terminal fishery starting in 2024. The waters of the fishery were defined in regulation and were closed to snagging and spear fishing from January 1 through June 23. Generally, the king salmon fishing success in Seldovia was similar to the NDFL and below the recent year’s average performance.\nManagement Actions\n\r\n    No management actions occurred in 2024.\r\n    \nPersonal Use Dip Net Fisheries\nChina Poot Creek\n\r\n    The BOF extended the season dates to start June 15 and continue through August 15 in the China Poot Creek personal use dip net fishery. This fishery does not require a permit for participation; harvest data are now available from the SWHS starting in 2022. The annual harvest estimates ranged from 11,000 fish in 2023 to 25,000 fish in 2022. The harvest estimate for 2024 is not yet available. The Division of Commercial Fisheries conducts weekly foot surveys to count sockeye and pink salmon. Success was fair at the start of the season and water conditions were high in the creek. Success was good for the remainder of the season with most participants easily obtaining limits. The success in this fishery is most likely attributed to changes in commercial fishing and cost recovery operations associated with the stocking.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n    No management actions occurred in 2024.\r\n    \nRockfish\nMarine Fisheries\n\r\n    The harvest of rockfish has increased steadily since 2013, and sustainable levels of rockfish harvest are currently unknown. The sport fishery is monitored with harvest data from the SWHS and Charter Logbook program, and biological data is monitored from the port sampling program in the Homer Harbor. Preliminary stock assessment work was reviewed in spring 2023 and changes in the biological data along with the increased harvest are indicators of a possible change in the population structure of rockfish in this area. Based on these conditions, the BOF reduced the rockfish bag and possession limits to 3 per day and 6 in possession starting in 2024. No harvest has been estimated for 2024 yet. The 2023 rockfish harvest was just over 41,000 fish, which was a 35% reduction from 2022. This reduction was attributed to the emergency order to reduce the bag limit from 5 to 3 fish.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n    No management actions occurred in 2024.\r\n    \nRazor Clams\nEast\n\r\n    All East Cook Inlet beaches remained closed to sport and personal use clamming for the start of 2024 until abundance surveys could be conducted in the spring. Surveys were conducted in April and May at both Clam Gulch and Ninilchik area beaches. Abundances of adult-sized razor clams at both beaches were below the threshold outlined in the management plan to open the fishery. Additionally, the abundance of juvenile clams at both beaches was below average and not sufficient to improve adult abundances over the next couple of seasons.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n    No management actions occurred in 2024.\r\n    \nWest\n\r\n   The West Cook Inlet beaches remained open to sport and personal use clamming in 2024. Harvest estimates for the sport fishery are not available yet, but clammers report good success at Polly Creek and Crescent River Bar areas, with larger clams found at Crescent River Bar. Based on department hand dug samples, the percentage of large size clams in the harvest is continuing to improve in West Cook Inlet.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\n\r\n    No management actions occurred in 2024.\r\n    \nTanner Crab\nCook Inlet Tanner Crab\n\r\n    No trawl surveys were conducted in 2023 or 2024, so the limited fishery was implemented for both seasons. Just over 2,100 permits were issued for the 2023–2024 season. Of these, 78% reported participating in the fishery and approximately 6% failed to report and will be denied a permit for the 2024–2025 season. For the 2023–2024 season, the harvest was 6,437 male Tanner crabs, which was slightly below the recent year’s average. Permits are only available through ADF&G’s online store for the 2024–2025 season.\r\n    \nManagement Actions\nNo management actions were implemented for the 2023–2024 fishery season.\nSee the printable PDF version, which includes a table of Region II Escapement Goals and Escapements - including some prior years."

The first few coho and pink salmon have been caught at Ship Creek, but fishing for these species will be slow for another few weeks as the runs build.\r\n\t\nWater levels have dropped on the creek. Use a spin-and-glow with roe fished on the bottom during the incoming and outgoing tides to target late returning king salmon. To target early arriving coho salmon, try fishing roe under slip bobber or casting medium spinners during the incoming tide.\n\n\n\nRainbow Trout/Dolly Varden/Arctic Char\n\nCampbell and Chester creeks are open to fishing. Both locations are freshly stocked with rainbow trout. Casting small spinners or fly fishing with nymphs or egg fly patterns are great options to catch rainbow trout and Dolly Varden.\r\n\t\nReminder: By emergency order, only single hooks are allowed and bait may not be used through July 31 on Campbell Creek.\n\n\n\nLocal Lakes\n\nMany of the Anchorage area lakes have received a second round of rainbow trout stocking. Freshly stocked fish will be schooled up and cruising around the lake. With the warmer weather, early morning and late evening will be the most productive times to fish local lakes. Try slowly stripping a wet fly, casting small spinners or fishing small bait under a bobber to catch these freshly stocked fish.\r\n\t\nFor those with canoes or small boats, Sand, Lower Fire, and Campbell Point Lakes are hot locations for stocked rainbow trout.\nCheney and Taku-Campbell lakes have decent access for shoreline anglers and fishing has been steady.\n\n\nWant to go for a hike and catch fish at the same time?\r\n\t\nSymphony Lake in Eagle River is ice-free and opened on July 1. Grayling and rainbow trout fishing should be great!\nRabbit Lake was also recently stocked with rainbow trout and is a great destination to take a hike and catch some fish.\n\n\n\nSpecial Species Information\nNorthern pike\nNorthern pike are not native to Anchorage area lakes. If you catch a pike in any Anchorage area lake, do not release it and immediately report it to the pike reporting page online here.\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nEffective May 1, Emergency Order 2-KS-2-9-25 closes sport fishing for king salmon in the Eagle River drainage for the season. In addition, sport fishing gear is limited to one unbaited, single-hook, artificial lure with a gap between the point and the shank of the hook that is half inch or less.\nEffective June 15, Emergency Order 2-KS-2-10-25 prohibits the use of bait and multiple hooks through July 31. Only one unbaited, single hook, artificial lure may be used from June 15– July 31.\n\nDon't forget to purchase your 2025 sport fishing license and king stamp!

Numbers at the Coghill River weir continue to improve and conditions are good for fishing. Daily sockeye salmon passage counts are available online.\nSockeye salmon are present throughout the Eyak River and just below the lake. Fishing has been slower as it is late in the run.\nSockeye are showing up in Alaganik Slough in Cordova in fishable numbers. Anglers are reporting mixed success throughout the slough, including at the upper and lower launches.\n\nCutthroat Trout/Dolly Varden\n\nCutthroat trout fishing has been excellent in lakes of Prince William Sound, including lakes around Cordova.\nDolly Varden and cutthroat trout fishing at the mouth of creeks has been good as they feed on out-migrating salmon fry.\n\nSaltwater Fishing\nHalibut\n\nAnglers making it out to the Gulf of Alaska are getting into good catches of large halibut near Montague Island and Hinchinbrook Entrance. Try fishing large circle hooks with herring or salmon bellies while anchored up with a chum bag.\nHalibut has been good inside Prince William Sound as halibut are well spread out. Try fishing depths of 200-300 ft on the outer edges of Perry and Naked Islands and the entrance of bays.\n\nLingcod\nLingcod fishing has been decent around rocky pinnacles near Elrington Island, Johnstone Bays, and Hinchinbrook Entrance. Try drifting over rocky structure with a white twister tail on a large jig tipped with herring.\nRockfish\n\nLarge schools of pelagic rockfish can typically be found near the entrances and the coastal outside waters and fishing can be hot. Boats are more consistently finding schools of pelagic rockfish in southwest and eastern Prince William Sound inside waters.\nDon’t forget your deepwater release device to release rockfish. Check out videos on the ADF&G YouTube page on how to properly release rockfish back down to depth.\n\nOther finfish\nFishing for Pacific (gray) cod and other flatfish has been good throughout Prince William Sound and outside waters while targeting other saltwater species. Use small chunks of herring on smaller hooks than you would use for halibut to target these other species.\nSalmon\n\nSockeye salmon are concentrated at the head of Main Bay and fishing is fair.\r\n\t\nCost recovery and broodstock goals have been achieved at Main Bay, and as a result the barrier seine may be pulled at the end of the week. Once the barrier seine is removed the regulations change and anglers can fish to within 300 feet of the fish ladder at the hatchery. Anglers are reminded not to interfere with hatchery equipment. Fishing will be good for the first few days, but anglers may need to sort through blushed fish.\n\n\nKing salmon fishing at Fleming Spit (in Cordova) remains slow, but fish could still trickle into the lagoon. Casting spinners or bait under a bobber around the tide works well to target these fish.\nLarge schools of pink and chum salmon are milling around throughout Prince William Sound. Anglers can easily pick up a few pink salmon near Whittier or Valdez if wanting to stay close to the ports.\nAnglers are reporting catches of pink salmon from shore in Valdez. Fishing will continue to build as more fish stack up near the hatchery in Valdez. Try casting spinners and spoons from Allison Point. Fishing will be hit and miss for pinks from shore as the commercial fishery will be active harvesting on a large return of pink salmon this year.\nAnglers trolling for salmon are still picking up king salmon and starting to catch coho salmon around Cape Cleare, Crafton, Glacier and Naked Islands, and Passage Canal. Coho fishing will continue to improve over the coming weeks.\n\nLocal lakes\nThompson Lake, Blueberry Lake, and Ruth Pond have all been stocked recently! These lakes can make for a fun outing to target multiple species including rainbow trout, Arctic grayling, and lake trout.\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nEmergency Order 2-KS-6-14-25 reduces the bag and possession limit for king salmon to one fish in the Prince William Sound Management Area salt waters, excluding the Whittier, Cordova, Valdez, and Chenega Terminal Harvest Areas which have a bag limit of two fish and a possession limit of four fish of any size through September 15.\nEmergency Order 2-RF-6-20-25 reduces the number of shrimp pots allowed to harvest shrimp in the Prince William Sound noncommercial (sport and subsistence) shrimp fishery to two pots per person with a maximum of two pots per vessel. Additionally, this emergency order reduces the open season for the Prince William Sound noncommercial shrimp fishery to May 1 – July 31.\n\nDon't forget to purchase your 2025 sport fishing license and king stamp!

All fresh waters between Gore Point and Cape Fairfield.\nFreshwater Fishing\nSalmon\n\nFreshwaters in Resurrection Bay downstream of the Seward Highway and Nash Road is open to salmon fishing. Fishing has been very slow for sockeye salmon but a few straggling sockeye are still available. Try locating small pods of fish that may have come in on the high tides.\r\n\t\nReminder: Only unbaited, single hook lures or flies are allowed in this section, and snagging is not permitted. The bag and possession limits are 3 for salmon other than king salmon (in combination), of which, only 2 may be coho salmon.\n\n\n\nSaltwater Fishing\nHalibut\n\nHalibut fishing has been good when the weather has allowed boats to travel out. Anglers are reporting catches of large fish outside of Resurrection Bay. Outside of the bay target halibut on flats off the edge of points and pinnacles in about 200-300 feet of water while on anchor. Use large circle hooks with herring or salmon bellies.\nFishing inside the bay has been productive as well, but mostly small to medium-sized halibut. Fish with large jigs tipped with herring while anchored up with a chum bag. Locations to try include Bulldog Cove, Hat Island, Mary’s Bay, and the drop off near Tonsina Creek.\n\nLingcod\nAnglers reported fair to good success fishing around rocky structures in the Gulf of Alaska over the last week. Rocky pinnacles and capes are excellent locations to target lingcod. Try drifting over rocky structure with a white twister tail on a large jig tipped with herring.\nRockfish\n\nAnglers have reported good catch rates of a variety of pelagic rockfish near the entrance of Resurrection Bay and along the Gulf Coast.\r\n\t\nReminder: Effective May 27 through September 15, only 2 pelagic rockfish may be retained as part of a total bag limit of 3 rockfish.\n\n\n\nSalmon\n\nKing salmon fishing has been slow to fair in Resurrection Bay by boat with anglers having to put in extra time to catch fish. Try trolling small herring near Derby Cove and Caines Head to target king salmon in the bay.\nFishing from shore near the lagoon outflow has been slow for hatchery king salmon, but fish are continuing to return. Casting spoons or snagging as the tide rises from shore can be productive if you put in the effort.\nSockeye fishing has been very slow. Sockeye salmon can be caught at the head of the bay near Spring Creek or Resurrection River with a lot of effort, and anglers should not expect to catch limits.\nCoho salmon are getting picked up near Driftwood Bay and the outer portions of Resurrection Bay, including Pony Cove and Cheval Narrows. Some fish are even being caught further inside the bay as close as Caines Head. Locating a school of coho and mooching with a hoochie squid and a small chunk of herring is a good method to target these salmon.\nThe Seward Lagoon and outfall stream is currently open for a youth-only king salmon fishing opportunity. A few king salmon are still in the lagoon and fishing could improve with some late arrivals.\r\n\t\nBy emergency order, this youth fishery is extended through July 31.\nReminder: Only one hook (single or treble) may be used during the youth-only fishery, but bait is permitted.\n\n\n\nLocal lakes\n\nFishing at First Lake has been very slow as most of the rainbow trout that were stocked in early summer have been caught.\nFishing at Troop Lake has been excellent for rainbow trout and Arctic char. It is a short hike, but where the trail meets the lake, anglers can catch rainbow trout easily. A pack raft could be used to explore the lake and improve fish size and catch rates. Small spinners or nymph fly patterns are a great way to target these hungry fish.\n\nSpecial species information\nDolly Varden have started to show up around the beaches in Seward, such as Spring Creek and Lowell Point. Fishing will improve as other salmon species, such as pink salmon, begin showing up. Try casting medium-size spinners or small spoons off the beach.\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nEffective May 27, Emergency Order 2-RF-7-21-25 reduces rockfish bag and possession limits in the salt waters of North Gulf Coast area (including Resurrection Bay) to 3 per day and 6 in possession of which only 2 per day and 4 in possession may be a pelagic rockfish and only 1 per day and 2 in possession may be nonpelagic rockfish from May 27 – September 15. In addition, yelloweye rockfish may not be retained from May 27 through June 30, 2025.\nEffective July 1, Emergency Order 2-KS-8-27-25 extends the youth only king salmon fishery in Seward Lagoon and the outfall stream through July 31.\n\nDon't forget to purchase your 2025 sport fishing license and king stamp!

Sport fishing gear is limited to one unbaited, single-hook, artificial lure with a gap between the point and shank of the hook of ½ inch or less. The Eklutna Tailrace is a stocked fishery where you can use bait and multiple hooks. Fishing has been fair to good. Try drifting bait under a bobber or a variety of lures in sizes 3-5. Kodiak customs, Vibrax, and Pixies work well.\nSockeye, pinks, and chums\n\nSome chums and pinks are making their way up the Susitna. Try the mouth of Deshka for pinks and perhaps an early coho salmon.\nChum, sockeye, and a few pinks are beginning to show up on the lower Little Su and generally the first coho is caught sometime this week.\nTry the weekend only fishery at the mouth of Cottonwood Creek for some bright sockeye salmon. It’s open to fishing 5 a.m.-10 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.\nFish Creek sockeye counts are posted on our webpage under Fish Counts. The sport fishery is closed by regulation on July 15 including weekends. Stay tuned in case the personal use fishery is opened by emergency order. The department must project more than 35,000 sockeye salmon prior to opening this dip net fishery. This fishery typically opens towards the end of July.\nThe Susitna personal use dipnet fishery first opener will be Saturday July 12 on the lower Susitna River. This fishery runs 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. on Wednesdays and Saturdays only from July 10 to July 31. The designated area for fishing is between regulatory markers posted approximately one mile downstream of Susitna Station (just below the Yentna River mouth) down to markers posted just below the Alexander Creek cut-off/northern tip of Bell Island. Access is by boat (18 miles) or plane only. Waters of the Susitna are dropping, providing more beach access in this fishery.\r\n\t\nThis fishery is part of the Upper Cook Inlet Personal Use permit. An Upper Cook Inlet Personal Use permit is required in addition to a sport fishing license. Only Alaska residents may participate in this fishery. Upper Cook Inlet Personal Use permit harvest and participation must be reported online no later than August 31 through the ADF&G harvest reporting webpage.\n\n\n\nRainbow Trout\n\nFishing for rainbows on the Parks Highway streams is good. Try Willow, Montana, Kashwitna, Little Willow, and Goose creeks. Fish wet flies like wooly buggers, leeches, sculpins and egg sucking leeches, soon beads will be the ticket. Grayling fishing has been good too. They like gold or yellow flies and lures, stick to small sizes. Try bead head nymphs, Elk Hair Caddis, Mayflies, or a good old Stone Fly.\nWillow Creek has multiple access points off Willow Fishhook Road. Montana Creek may be accessed at several locations off the Talkeetna Spur Road. Single day float trips are popular on Willow and Montana creeks.\nFurther north, tributaries of the Chulitna, such as Honolulu Creek and Byers Creek should also provide good rainbow trout fishing opportunities.\n\nNorthern Pike\n\nFor road-accessible pike fishing, try the Nancy Lake Recreation Area lakes, Big Lake, Long Lake near Willow, Memory, and Prator Lakes.\nBoat-accessible pike fishing can be found in the side sloughs of the Deshka River, Alexander Creek, Fish Creek (Kroto Slough), and Hewitt Lake.\nFor fly-in pike fishing try Alexander Lake, Shell Lake, Eightmile Lake, Trapper Lake, Flathorn Lake, and Sucker Lake.\n\nLocal Lakes\nSummit Lake in Hatcher Pass was recently stocked. This lake is in a beautiful spot and the road over the pass is open. Enjoy fishing and hiking while the summer weather is at its best. Other aesthetically pleasing lakes include the lakes up the Glenn HWY, Long Lake (Mile 86), Ravine, or Knob Lakes off the Alascom Road.\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nEmergency Order 2-KS-2-06-25 Closes the Susitna River drainage to sport fishing for king salmon. In addition, sport fishing gear is limited to one unbaited, single-hook, artificial lure with a gap between the point and shank of the hook that is one-half inch or less in the Susitna River drainage (Units 1-6).\nEmergency Order 2-KS-2-05-25 Closes the Little Susitna to sport fishing for king salmon and limits gear to one unbaited, single-hook, artificial lure with a gap of one-half inch or less when fishing for other species.\nEmergency Order 2-KS-2-11-25 Closes all waters of West Cook Inlet Management Area to sport fishing for king salmon.\n\nDon't forget to purchase your 2025 sport fishing license and king stamp! You can purchase and display your fishing license and king stamp, record your annual harvest (i.e. king salmon), access sport fishing regulations and locations, and so much more on your mobile device. Download the ADF&G Mobile App today. You can also purchase licenses through the ADF&G online store and print it off from the comfort of your own home.

Fishing reports are mixed, but there has been some success at the mouth on incoming tides.\nSaltery is getting good numbers of sockeye, though it’s a little slower than last year. The limit is still 5 per day until more fish are counted at the weir. There sounds like decent numbers of fish holding from the Bed Springs to the Weir.\nPasagshak has counted about 1,100 sockeye, though recent rains flooded the weir. From most accounts, there have been a lot of fish coming in the river and fishing has been good with each tide.\nPinks are starting to show up around town and in many rivers. The Buskin is starting to get pinks and fishing near the mouth and from the beach should be good for bright pinks.\nNo word on hatchery king salmon. Returns are expected at Salonie and Monashka this year but have been very small runs recently and expected to be the same in 2025.\nDollies are still being caught off local beaches now with the mouth of the Buskin, Mission Beach and the beaches in Kalsin and Chiniak being the usual hot spots.\n\nSaltwater Fishing\n\nKing salmon fishing was good for the few days the weather was calm enough. The Fingers area sounds like the most popular spot at the moment but some folks are still finding fish between the Islands.\nSilvers are being caught as well at Buoy 4 and the Fingers. Pinks are starting to get thick as well.\nHalibut are being found in the usual places in Chiniak Bay with fish in the 20-40 lb range being most common. Kodiak Rocks, Buoy 4 and between Woody and Long Islands have been spots with recent success. Some recent reports indicate quite a few small fish (<5 lbs) showing up too.\nRockfish fishing has been good with most rock piles and reefs in Chiniak Bay producing good catches. Lots of folks are figuring out the new rockfish regulations and having success finding a variety of species after they fill their limit of 2 black rockfish. Duskies can often be found in places that are common for trolling for salmon and are a good option to pursue. They tend to move around more than other species to feed on traveling schools of bait fish.\nLingcod season opened Tuesday July 1, but with the weather, not many fish seemed to have been encountered so far.\n\nLocal Lakes\nThere are four lakes right in town that are stocked with rainbow trout: Lily, Dark, Island, and Abercrombie. Lily and Dark Lakes have the best fishing by most accounts but fishing from shore is a little tougher due to private land ownership around much of the lake shore. For a quick morning or evening fishing trip, Island and Abercrombie offer lots of spots to fish from shore or even the relatively new dock at Abercombie.\nSpecial Species Information\n\nNew rockfish regulations took effect April 1 for Kodiak and Afognak waters north of Dangerous and Cape Ikolik. This includes all the waters of Afognak, Raspberry and Shuyak Islands as well as Chiniak, Ugak and Marmot Bays and all of Whale Pass, Kupreanof Straight and the Westside of Kodiak Island. It is also in effect for all anglers, both resident and non-resident.\nAnglers fishing in these waters can keep 5 rockfish per day, but only 2 can be of a single species. This is similar to salmon bag limits in the Kodiak Road Zone and an example would be that an angler could harvest 2 black rockfish, 2 dusky rockfish and a yelloweye. Species ID guides are available in the Southwest Alaska Regulation Booklet, on the ADF&G website and in the Kodiak ADF&G office.\nThe standard bag limit for yelloweye rockfish is still in effect Island wide, only one fish of your rockfish bag limit may be a yelloweye.\nAfter similar regulations were implemented last season, many anglers found that shifting their fishing behavior slightly resulted in increased rockfish catches of species other than Black Rockfish, which are typically most commonly caught. Dark Rockfish, Dusky Rockfish and other species can often be found just off the side of a rock pile or reef and in deeper water than black rockfish that typically prefer the top of and middle of these structures.\nKeep an eye out for some of the species you may not have realized we have in Kodiak: Widow, Yellowtail, Canary, Tiger, Northern and Silvergray rockfish are some of these.\nNew for Kodiak waters are Emergency Orders restricting saltwater king salmon harvest. The Island-wide king salmon bag limit has been reduced to 1 fish per day, with no annual limit to align with the rest of the Gulf of Alaska for the 2025 season.\n\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nNEW! Emergency Order 2-RS-4-22-25 increased the bag and possession limit for sockeye salmon in the Buskin River Drainage to 5 per day effective Wednesday June 18, 2025. This is a combined salmon bag limit, of which all 5 may be sockeye salmon.\nEmergency Order 2-RF-4-19-25 reduced the bag and possession limit for a single species of rockfish to 2 per day, 4 in possession north of Outlet Cape and Cape Ikolik. This emergency order is in effect from Tuesday April 1, 2025 through 11:59 pm. Wednesday, December 31, 2025.\nEmergency Order 2-KS-4-12-25 closed the Karluk River drainage (including the lagoon and its outlet stream) and the Ayakulik River drainage to king salmon fishing and restricted fishing gear to only one unbaited, single-hook artificial lure through 11:59 p.m. Friday, July 25, 2025.\nEmergency Order 2-KS-4-16-25 reduce the bag and possession limit for king salmon in the Kodiak Area to 1 per day from 12:01am Tuesday, April 1, 2025 through 11:59 p.m. Monday, September 15, 2025.\n\nDon't forget to purchase your 2025 sport fishing license and king stamp!

This week would be a great time to catch your fill of sockeye salmon for the grill, smoker, and freezer.\n\nSaltwater Fishing\r\nKachemak Bay/Cook Inlet\nGroundfish\n\nHalibut fishing continues to be really good, but some locations have been spotty. Plenty of large fish were caught over the holiday weekend. Try moving locations or drifting to find fish.\nBoth lingcod and yelloweye seasons are open. Most anglers travel to the outer coast to find success with them. Fishing was good over the weekend for both species and should continue to be productive on conducive weather days.\nSurf fishing has remained a popular option for those anglers without boats. Whiskey Gulch and Deep Creek are great locations to try for halibut. Fishing off the tip of the Homer Spit is still producing a variety of groundfish including halibut, sculpins, skates, sharks, flounders, and cod.\n\nKing Salmon\nKing salmon fishing was poor to fair over the week. July is usually the slowest month for king salmon. There are good numbers of pink salmon at Point Pogibshi, which can be challenging to target king salmon there. Try fishing deeper to avoid the pink salmon. Small troll herring or spoons behind a flasher is the most popular setup, but hootchies and tube flies will also produce fish. To find king salmon at any location, try setting the gear at different depths including mid-water column and 10 feet off the bottom.\nSockeye Salmon\nThere should be a good number of sockeye salmon around Tutka Lagoon and in front of China Poot Creek. Most anglers snag these fish with weighted treble hooks.\nCoho Salmon\nThere are scattered reports of coho salmon in the Nick Dudiak Lagoon and trolling in the outer portions of Kachemak Bay. Expect poor fishing over the next week until the runs start showing up in better numbers.\nEmergency Orders\n“Please review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\nAnchor River and Deep Creek Closed to Sport Fishing\nSport Fishing For King Salmon Closed in Upper Cook Inlet Salt Waters\nKing Salmon Bag Limit Reduced from 2 to 1 in Lower Cook Inlet Salt Waters\nChanges to King Salmon Gear in the Ninilchik River\nRockfish bag limit reduction: 2 pelagic, 1 non-pelagic. No retention of yelloweye May 27 – June 30th.\nFor additional information, please contact the Homer ADF&G Office at 907-235-8191."

(Neither the ADF&G Permanent ID license nor the ADF&G Disabled Veteran's license expire.)\nThe sport fishing regulations are good through April 15 of the new year. Look for new booklets around March or early April.\nIce Fishing\nADF&G does not monitor ice thickness, ice thickness can vary widely from system to system. By mid-November, some lakes may have 5 inches of ice, and some only 1 inch. If you are unsure of the ice thickness, punch a hole near shore and measure before venturing farther on lake ice. Always play it safe. Once lake ice is safe enough for travel (6 inches of clear ice for foot traffic), ice fishing is usually great on the area's many stocked lakes.\n* For ice conditions on Municipality of Anchorage lakes, call Municipality Parks and Recreation at (907) 343-4474.\r\n* For lake ice and snow pack conditions on Fort Richardson Army Base, try (907) 384-2744\r\n* For lake ice and snow pack conditions on Elmendorf Air Force Base, try (907) 552-2282 or 2436.\r\n* For ice and snow pack conditions in Chugach State Park, call (907) 345-5014.\nAbout a dozen Anchorage area lakes are stocked with catchable-sized Chinook salmon for winter ice fishing, and many lakes still have good populations of rainbows left from summer stocking. Some of the local area lakes stocked for ice fishing include: Beach, Campbell Point (Kincaid Park), Clunie, Delong, Jewel, Mirror and Sand Lakes. Many of these lakes are also stocked during the summer with other popular fish, like grayling, Arctic Char and lake trout to provide anglers with an opportunity catch different species. Anglers can check the status of lake stocking by using the stocking database on our website. The stocked lake database used on our Internet site is usually updated on Thursdays, so check back each Friday to get the latest information. The web pages also have links to maps of the area's stocked lakes, showing the contours of the labeled. Stocked lakes are also listed in the regulation booklet.\r\nLake Fishing: Rainbow Trout\nUnless an Emergency Order has been issued, the limit for rainbow trout in stocked lakes and streams is 5 fish per day, and only 1 trout can be over 20 inches. You may have 5 unpreserved rainbow trout in your possession. These fish are typically more difficult to catch through the ice, but fishing improves during the lengthening days of spring.\nLake Fishing: Landlocked Salmon\nThese fish are stocked specifically for the winter ice fishery. They are typically about eight inches in length and feed aggressively all winter. Children as young as 2 and 3 years old can these fish. The easiest way to catch these fish is to suspend a small baited jig 5 to 10 feet below a bobber, then move the jig up and down. Fresh shrimp, canned clams, and single salmon eggs work the best as bait. Avoid using corn or other vegetables as bait - these fish cannot quickly digest these items, which will block the digestive tract and slowly kill the fish. The limit for catchable salmon in stocked lakes is 5 fish per day, and you may have only 5 unpreserved landlocked salmon in your possession.\nLake Fishing: Arctic Char\nSand and Campbell Point lakes are both stocked with catchable-sized Arctic char, about 8 to 10 inches long. Sometimes, however, a small number of excess “brood” char are also stocked into these two lakes. These brood char are usually about 24 inches long. These fish are also feeding all winter and can be caught by jigging a baited lure just off the bottom of the lake. Swedish Pimples, and Castmaster-like jigs baited with cured salmon eggs are popular char lures. The limit for Dolly Varden/Arctic Char in stocked lakes is 5 per day/5 in possession.\nEvery year, ice-fishing anglers are ticketed for having more than their daily limit of fish. Don’t be a statistic! It’s 5 trout and 10 salmon and 5 char per day, NOT PER LAKE/STREAM!\nOnly 2 trout per person per day may be kept from lakes or streams that are not stocked.\nIntroduced Species: Northern Pike\nPike fishing success is great during ice fishing season on Lower Fire Lake. All other Anchorage lakes have been eradicated of pike as they are an introduced species. Jig bright, shiny lures, or swing your decoy. Spearing through a hole in the ice is legal. These fish also become more active during the winter as the days get longer. Females preparing to spawn in the spring feed readily and catch rates tend to increase during the late winter. We appreciate all your help in controlling this illegally introduced species. There is no bag limit for northern pike in Anchorage area waters. If you catch one in any Anchorage area lake besides Lowere Fire Lake, please notify ADF&G Invasive Species Division.  If you don’t want to use the pike you catch, we suggest contacting a local charity to see if they would appreciate a donation of fresh fish. Many pike recipes can be found on the Internet. ADF&G also has a handout with two recipes, as well as pike fishing tips and a listing of all known or suspected pike waters.\nPeople who are dumping pike into local waterways are a real threat to your recreational fisheries. Anyone with any information on illegal stockings is encouraged to contact Fish and Wildlife Safeguard at 1-800-478-3377 or State Troopers' Fish and Wildlife Protection at (907) 269-5954 or 269-5541.\nStream Fishing: Rainbow Trout/Dolly Varden - Flowing Waters\nIce fishing for rainbow trout and Dolly Varden on Campbell Creek (or any other Anchorage area flowing water) is highly dependent on location. Campbell Creek trout and Dollies probably overwinter in Campbell Lake, which is closed to all fishing. If you know of a deep pool or beaver pond upstream from Campbell Lake, you can try there. Upstream of the forks near Piper Street, no bait is allowed, and you must use single hooks - no treble hooks or multiple hooks. Also upstream of the forks, Campbell Creek is catch-and-release only for rainbows. Daily limits are the same as for stocked lakes October through February."

(Neither the ADF&G Permanent ID license nor the ADF&G Disabled Veteran's license expire.)\nThe sport fishing regulations are good through April 15 of the new year. Look for new booklets in late March or early April.\nIce Fishing\nEarly spring ice fishing is slow for landlocked salmon, but can be decent for rainbow trout and pike. You can check the stocking records on our website to find out which lakes were stocked for ice fishing. The web pages also have links to maps of the area’s stocked lakes, showing the contours of the lakebed. You can also find a listing of stocked lakes in the regulation booklet.\nAlthough the ice usually does not break up until mid-May, mild winters or unusually warm temperatures may weaken the ice in March and April. Be sure to chop or drill test holes before going out too far on the ice. Once the ice does melt, it usually melts near the shoreline first. Casting over these open water leads towards the edge of the receding ice is usually the avid angler’s first fishing experience of the year.\nJigging lures or using bait near drop off areas still works well for rainbow trout and catchable salmon. The more popular baits include fresh (not frozen) cocktail shrimp, single eggs, or preserved egg clusters. For lake trout/char, fish the bottom of the deepest hole you can find. Corn is not recommended, because it can clog up the digestive tract of fish. If you release a fish, or if other fish feed on the corn, they may die. Tossing a few eggshells through the hole helps with visibility.\nTravel on the ice is at your own risk. Ice thickness can vary widely from system to system. ADF&G does not monitor ice thickness. Sometimes the manager of the land around the lake does that, as time allows.\n\nFor ice conditions on Municipality of Anchorage lakes try the Municipality Parks and Recreation at (907) 343-4474.\nFor lake ice and snowpack conditions on Fort Richardson Army Base, try (907) 384-2744.\nFor lake ice and snowpack conditions on Elmendorf Air Force Base, try (907) 552-2282 or 2436.\nFor ice and snow pack conditions in Chugach State Park, call (907) 345-5014.\n\nUnless an Emergency Order has been issued, the limit for rainbow trout in stocked lakes and streams is 5 fish per day, and only 1 trout can be over 20 inches.

It’s 5 trout and 5 salmon and 5 char per day, NOT PER LAKE/STREAM!\nOnly 2 trout per person per day may be kept from lakes or streams that are not stocked.\nNorthern Pike\nPike fishing success is great in late winter and early spring. Pike are spring spawners, often spawning under the ice. Before spawning, pike are very active, and actively chase shiny lures and jigs. Head to Lower Fire Lake which is the only lake where pike should be found in Anchorage. Eradication efforts have taken place in all other Anchorage lakes where ADF&G had previously confirmed pike had been introduced. Spearing is legal, as is bow and arrow fishing. The arrow must have a barbed tip, and be attached to the bow by a line.\nWe appreciate all your help in controlling this illegally-introduced species. There is no bag limit for northern pike in Anchorage area waters. If you don’t want to use the pike you catch, we suggest contacting a local charity to see if they would appreciate a donation of fresh fish. Many pike recipes can be found on the Internet.

Anyone with any information on illegal stockings is encouraged to contact Fish and Wildlife Safeguard at 1-800-478-3377 or State Troopers’ Fish and Wildlife Protection at (907) 269-5954 or 269-5541.\nRainbow Trout/Dolly Varden - Flowing Waters\nMarch and April usually see the end of the ice-covered months on the area’s flowing waters. The ice on Campbell Creek is often unsafe in March and April.\nOnce open water develops, look for deep pools or beaver ponds, and cast your small lure or fly through those. Fishing success will go down if the water is muddy from snowmelt.\nUpstream of the forks near Piper Street, no bait is allowed, and you must use single hooks – no treble hooks or multiple hooks. Also upstream of the forks, Campbell Creek is catch-and-release only for rainbows. Daily limits are the same as for stocked lakes.\nHooligan (Eulachon/Smelt)\nAlthough it technically opens April 1, the hooligan run to the Twentymile River usually does not pick up until late April. The run usually peaks in mid- to late May, and the season closes in salt waters on May 31, and June 15 for fresh waters.\nAll hooligan runs are very changeable in size and timing. You must be an Alaska resident to use a dipnet to catch hooligan. You must also have your fishing license (or ADF&G Permanent ID Card or ADF&G Disabled Veteran’s Card, as appropriate). Dipping on the rising tide just after a rain usually gives the best success, since hooligan seem to wait for high water. Check your local newspaper for the Anchorage tides, and add about 45 minutes to the high tide time to get the time of high tide at Twentymile.March through April"

    "full_text": "May Season\nSalmon\nKing salmon begin to return to Ship Creek in downtown Anchorage in mid-May, and fishing picks up by the end of May. This early in the run, best success is usually at slack high tide, or 1-2 hours before and after high tide. Bait and treble hooks are allowed.\nWhile most Ship Creek kings average 20-25 lbs., there are a few 50+ pounders available. Anglers harvest about 3,800 kings every year. The majority of the land around Ship Creek is owned by the Alaska Railroad, and is located in an industrial area. Please follow all posted signs, and be careful around heavy equipment.\nAlthough a small portion of Eagle River is open to weekend-only king fishing beginning Memorial Day weekend, the river has not been stocked since 1994, and very few fish return. Bait and treble hooks are legal in Eagle River. Check the regulation booklet for the area open to king salmon fishing.\nOnce you harvest a king salmon 20 inches or more in length from a Cook Inlet drainage, you must immediately record that fish on the back of your license or on your Annual Harvest Record card. Kids under 16 and permanent license holders can get a harvest record card free from most major license vendors. The bag/possession limits for Chinook salmon are 1 per day, or 5 for the entire season. Also, in Ship Creek and Eagle River, once you have harvested a king salmon you may not fish in waters open to king salmon fishing for the remainder of the day.\nAll other streams in the Anchorage area are closed to king salmon sport fishing with the exception of a Youth only fishery on Campbell Creek that takes place on the last Saturday and Sunday in June each year. Be sure to check the regulation book for specific details on this fishery.\nRainbow Trout and Dolly Varden — Flowing Waters\nOnce the spring melt-off is gone and the creeks clear up, rainbow trout and Dolly Varden fishing in Chester and Campbell creeks can be excellent. A few rainbow trout are also available in the middle reaches of Ship Creek. Both Campbell and Chester Creeks are stocked with rainbow trout, and some natural reproduction of stocked rainbows also occurs. Both streams have native populations of Dolly Varden.\nBE AWARE: different sections of the same Anchorage area stream may have different gear regulations as well as different bag/possession limits. Check the regulation booklet carefully and know exactly where you are fishing.\nHooligan/Smelt\nHooligan return to Twentymile and Placer rivers in early to mid-May. Runs are often sporadic, with fish waiting for cool, high water to travel upstream.\nONLY ALASKAN RESIDENTS with a sport fishing license in their possession can dipnet for hooligan. A long-handled dip net fished at the mouth of Twentymile or Placer rivers or along the rocky beaches jutting out into the southern end of Turnagain Arm provides the best success. Dipping on the rising or flood tide usually produces the best results, and a tide of at least 25 feet as measured at Anchorage is recommended. Dip netting is allowed in saltwater through May 31 and in freshwater through June 15. Gillnets may not be used in Turnagain Arm. Use common sense while pursuing hooligan and do not venture out onto the mud flats.\nStocked Lakes\nBy mid- to late May, most Anchorage area lakes are ice free and have been stocked with hatchery-raised rainbow trout. These fish, as well as fish that have over-wintered provide an excellent spring fishing opportunity. A few Anchorage-area lakes receive hatchery-raised Arctic grayling, lake trout, or Arctic char. Check the stocking updates and lake maps on our webpage. Best success is early in the morning, or at dusk. Bait, spinners, and small flies are effective.\nEvery year we have numerous reports about anglers taking more than their legal limit of fish from area stocked lakes. These fish are easy to catch and provide local anglers, unable to venture into the field, with good fishing opportunity. Be aware of bag/possession limits, and do not harvest more than allowed to let more anglers share this bounty.\nNorthern Pike\nMay is an excellent time to fish for the Anchorage area's illegally-introduced northern pike, as they become voracious feeders after spawning. Your best bet is Lower Fire Lake as all other Anchorage area lakes have been eracdicated of pike.\nThis illegally introduced species is threatening our stocked lakes program and some wild salmon stocks. Please keep any pike you catch, but remember that \"wanton waste\" laws apply. There is no daily bag limit for pike and spears as well as bow and arrow are legal gear. The arrow must be barbed and attached to the bow. A free pamphlet with maps and Anchorage area lake information, along with pike cleaning and cooking tips is available at Department of Fish and Game offices or on the Department Internet pages.\nAnyone with any information on these illegal-stocking activities is encouraged to contact Fish and Wildlife Safeguard at 1-800-478-3377 or State Troopers’ Fish and Wildlife Protection at (907) 269-5954 or 269-5541."

    "full_text": "June Season\nSalmon\nMid-June sees the peak for fishing for hatchery-stocked king salmon in Ship Creek. Most fish are taken either during slack high tide or 1-2 hours before and after high tide. While most Ship Creek kings average 20-25 lbs., there are a few 50+ pounders available. Once the peak of the run has past, fishing continues to be fair through the season closure in July. Some of the more popular tackle includes large VibraxTM spinners, Spin-n-GlosTM, PixeesTM, yarn flies – some with fluorescent corkies, and fresh salmon roe.\nThe Ship Creek King Salmon Derby, which benefits the Downtown Soup Kitchen, takes place in early June. Check the local tackle shops or newspapers for more information.\nAlthough angler success fishing for king salmon in Eagle River is often poor, it does represent a slim opportunity. Eagle River king fishing is weekend only (Saturday, Sunday and Monday) for three weekends in June. Check the regulation booklet for dates.\nBait is legal in both of these king salmon sport fisheries. Once you have harvested a king salmon, you must immediately record that harvest on the back of your fishing license, or on an ADF&G Annual Harvest Record Card (see the regulations). Also, once you harvest a king salmon from the Anchorage Management Area, you may not fish for any species of fish in waters open to king salmon fishing for the remainder of the day.\nKing and red (sockeye) salmon begin their annual migration up Campbell Creek in early-June. Anglers are reminded that except for a kids-only fishery, the entire Campbell Creek drainage is closed to king and red salmon sport fishing, including catch-and-release. Poaching is a big problem at Campbell Creek. Enforcement personnel from Fish and Wildlife Protection and Anchorage Police Department officers have beefed up their patrols along Campbell Creek as a result.\nAll other waters in the Anchorage area are closed to king salmon sport fishing year-round, including Bird Creek.\nIf you see any illegal fishing please call the Alaska State Troopers’ Fish and Wildlife Protection office (269-5954 or 269-5541), or the Fish and Wildlife Safeguard “Report Poachers” hotline (1-800-478-3377) or the Alaska Department of Fish and Game Southcentral Region Information Center (267-2218).\nThere’s a kids-only king salmon fishery on Campbell Creek in the last weekend of June. Only youth 15 or younger may fish in a special section of the creek, on Saturday and Sunday. Daily limit and harvest recording requirements apply. This is a great opportunity to teach kids how to fish for salmon, and there are often educational events as well.\nRainbows and Dolly Varden/Arctic Char — Flowing Waters\nRainbow trout and Dolly Varden fishing should be fair to good in Campbell Creek upstream of Dowling and fair in Chester Creek near Behm/APU Lake. Some rainbow anglers like to fish Ship Creek from Reeve Boulevard to Department markers upstream of the Chugach dam, but remember, this reach is no bait, single-hook, artificial lures only, and rainbow trout cannot be kept.\nUpstream of the forks at Piper Street, Campbell Creek turns to unbaited, single-hook, artificial lures only, and rainbow trout cannot be kept in these waters.\nRainbows and Dollies often become less active as the sun climbs the sky. Best success is usually early in the morning, or later in the evening. Fish the deep pools, or the deeper channels.\nLakes\nJune is an excellent month to try one of Anchorage’s stocked lakes. Rainbow trout from 8\" to 12\" provide good to excellent fishing in the early morning hours! Some lakes receive Arctic grayling, and some Arctic char. Small spinners and flies are effective (size 10 or 12), while the best baits include raw shrimp, salmon eggs, and worms. The lakes are a great opportunity to introduce a youngster (or oldster!) to fishing.\nA free brochure with maps and area lake information is available at Department of Fish and Game offices. Also visit our stocked lakes maps and the fish stocking updates web pages.\nNorthern Pike\nIllegally-introduced northern pike are present in Lower Fire Lake. Pike have been eradicated from all other Anchorage area lakes that had confirmed reports of illegal introduction. There is no daily bag limit for pike and spears and bow and arrow are legal. Hunt for pike in shallow, weedy areas. As the water warms up, the pike become more lethargic, so pike anglers have better luck early in the morning and later in the evenings. Bait and multiple hooks are legal, and be sure to keep all the pike you catch. If it’s more than you can eat, check with your favorite charity to see if they would like to accept some fresh fish. Remember: it’s illegal to waste sport-caught fish.\nHooligan/Smelt\nEven though the Turnagain Arm hooligan run winds down by the end of the first week of June, fish should be available through the season closure of June 15 in the Twentymile River. Dippers are reminded that dipnetting in saltwater along Turnagain Arm closed May 31.\nOnly Alaska residents with a sport fishing license in possession can use a dipnet for hooligan. Dipping on the rising or flood tide usually produces the best results, and while a tide of at least 25 feet as measured at Anchorage is recommended, fish are available at any tide stage. Gillnets may not be used in Turnagain Arm. Use common sense while pursuing hooligan and do not venture out onto the mud flats."

A reminder: once you have harvested a king salmon, you must immediately record that harvest on the back of your fishing license, or on an ADF&G Annual Harvest Record Card (see the regulations). Also, once you harvest a king salmon, you may not fish for any species of fish in waters open to king salmon fishing for the remainder of the day.\nBy mid-July silver salmon start to return to Anchorage’s Ship Creek and Campbell Creek, as well as Bird Creek, which is about 27 miles south of downtown Anchorage on the Seward Highway. Most silvers caught in Ship and Bird creeks are taken about two hours before high tide, or 1 hour after high tide. In Campbell Creek, most silver success is early in the morning, before the sun shines onto the creek. Ship Creek and Bird Creek silver salmon fisheries peak in late July to early August, while Campbell Creek peaks around mid- to late August. All are hatchery release-driven fisheries.\nCampbell Creek opens to silver salmon fishing from Dimond Boulevard upstream to Shelikof Street on July 14. Campbell Creek has two sections closed to all fishing year-round. They are those sections of Campbell Creek/Campbell Lake downstream of Dimond Blvd. to Cook Inlet, and Campbell Creek between Shelikof Street and Lake Otis Parkway. Open seasons and legal tackle vary according to which section of this stream you are fishing. Be sure to check out the map in the regulation booklet and know where you are when you fish.\nOn even-numbered years, good numbers of pink salmon also enter Ship and Bird creeks. Pinks are an excellent way to introduce youngsters (and other novice salmon anglers) to fishing.\nStreams at the head of Turnagain Arm — such as the Placer River and the Twentymile River — also start to see adult salmon returning to spawn. Starting in mid- to late July both of these streams have wild runs of pink and chum salmon starting to show, along with a few silvers.\nThe bag and possession limit for salmon (other than king salmon 20” or longer) in all Turnagain streams, with the exception of hatchery enhanced streams (Bird, Ship and Campbell creeks), is 3 salmon of which only 2 can be silver salmon. In Bird, Ship, and Campbell creeks, daily limits for salmon (other than king salmon 20\" or longer) are 3 per day/3 in possession, and all 3 can be coho (silver) salmon. All Turnagian Arm stream are closed to fishing for king salmon, including catch and release.\nSome of the more popular silver and pink tackle includes medium VibraxTM spinners, Spin-n-GlosTM, PixeesTM, yarn flies – some with fluorescent corkies, and fresh salmon roe. Bait is legal in the Ship, Bird, and Campbell creek salmon sport fisheries. Salmon eggs under a bobber at high slack tide on Ship Creek is a very effective method for silvers.\nPoaching\nKing and red (sockeye) salmon are still migrating up Campbell Creek in July. Anglers are reminded that the entire Campbell Creek drainage is closed to king and red salmon sport fishing, including catch-and-release. Poaching is a big problem at Campbell Creek. Enforcement personnel from Fish and Wildlife Protection and Anchorage Police Department officers have beefed up their patrols along Campbell Creek as a result. If you see any illegal fishing please call either the Alaska State Troopers’ Fish and Wildlife Protection office (269-5954 or 269-5541) Fish and Wildlife Safeguard’s “Report Poachers” hotline (1-800-478-3377) or the Alaska Department of Fish and Game Southcentral Region Information Center (267-2218).\nRainbows and Dolly Varden / Arctic Char — Flowing Waters\nRainbow trout and Dolly Varden fishing should be fair to good in Campbell Creek upstream of Dowling and fair in Chester Creek near University/APU Lake.

    "full_text": "August Season\nSalmon\nMany Anchorage area silver salmon runs are in full swing in August. First to appear are the hatchery-enhanced fish at Ship and Bird creeks, followed by the hatchery-enhanced run at Campbell Creek. Area native runs are also well underway during August, and often run into September.\nOn even-numbered years, a fair number of pink salmon are also available in the area streams open to salmon fishing.\nMost people fish Ship and Bird creek 1-2 hours before and after high tide, but when the runs are at peak (early-mid August) fish can be available at all tidal stages. VibraxTM and PixeesTM are perennial Alaskan favorites as are “yarn flies,” though silvers and pinks will often bite at almost any shiny lure. Bait, such as preserved salmon eggs or cut herring is also popular (and allowed) in the Ship and Bird creek salmon fishery. The Ship Creek silver salmon Derby usually takes place during the first two weeks of August.\nThe Campbell Creek salmon fishery has special opening schedules, and silver salmon are the ONLY salmon you are allowed to fish for on that creek.\nOn July 14, Campbell Creek is open to silver salmon sport fishing from markers under the Dimond Boulevard bridge upstream to the markers at Shelikof Street and then from the Lake Otis Parkway bridge upstream to the forks near Piper Street. Campbell Creek is closed to all sport fishing between Shelikof Street and the Lake Otis Parkway bridge (Wickersham subdivision), and downstream of Dimond Boulevard (including Campbell Lake).\nLow, clear water conditions and warm, sunny days often spook the Campbell Creek silvers. Best silver fishing usually happens after rainy weather, when water temperatures drop, and water levels rise. Look for deep holes, and drift your lure or bait through the hole. Most fishing effort takes place downstream of Dowling Blvd. to the Dimond Blvd. bridge.\nThe more popular streams with natural runs are the Twentymile, Portage, and Placer river drainages. These runs usually peak in late August or early September. Anglers usually use shiny lures, and bait is also sometimes used. Remember that the upper reaches of Twentymile, Glacier, and Carmen rivers, an un-named slough on lower Portage Creek, as well as portions of Lower Explorer and Skookum creeks closed to sport fishing July 14. Placer Creek in Bear Valley (near the Whittier tunnel) is closed year-round to salmon fishing, but open year-round to for all other species. Consult the Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing regulation booklet before heading out to fish these areas and know where you are fishing.\nIn the Anchorage area, the bag limit for salmon 16\" or longer (other than kings) is three per day and in possession. On Ship, Bird, and Campbell creeks, all three salmon may be silvers. On all other streams open to silver salmon fishing, which include portions of Eklutna River, Eagle River, Glacier Creek, California Creek, Twentymile River, Portage Creek, and the Placer River drainages, only 2 of your 3 may be silvers. King salmon sport fishing is closed.\nRainbow Trout/Dolly Varden - Flowing Waters\nWhen weather and water conditions are perfect — not too muddy from recent rains, and not too hot — rainbow trout and Dolly Varden fishing on Campbell Creek can be excellent. Remember that upstream of the forks near Piper Street, it's catch-and-release only for rainbows, and you can use only single-hook, unbaited, artificial lures.\nLake Fishing\nThe Anchorage area stocked lakes are consistent producers of fun fishing! As the weather cools, lake fishing usually gets better and better, offering an alternative to shoulder-to-shoulder salmon angling. Check our website for maps to the lakes and stocking information. Three Anchorage area lakes, Jewel, Delong and Mirror lakes, are usually stocked with rainbow trout three times each year, with the last stocking in late August. Best baits are usually single salmon eggs or fresh shrimp. Small spinners and flies are also very effective. Fly-fishing during the fall from a belly boat is an excellent way to catch these late-stocked fish.\nNorthern Pike\nNorthern pike were illegally introduced into Sand Lake, Lower Fire Lake, Cheney Lake, and Otter Lake. They have been eradicated in all but Lower Fire Lake. There is no limit on pike in the Anchorage area and spears are legal. Anglers pursuing pike with rod and reel are encouraged to target pike, but remember, snagging and wasting speared or rod and reel caught pike is illegal. Effective lures include top-water \"poppers\" and \"buzz baits.\"\nFolks that are dumping pike into local lakes are a real threat to your recreational fisheries. Anyone with any information on these illegal-stocking activities is encouraged to contact Fish and Wildlife Safeguard at 1-800-478-3377 or State Troopers’ Fish and Wildlife Protection at (907) 269-5954 or 269-5541."

    "full_text": "September Season\nSalmon\nSilver salmon runs to Anchorage area streams wind down quickly in September. Best places to try are upstream on the Twentymile, Portage, and Placer river drainages. Best success is from boats, so if you plan on chasing ducks in the area, don’t put away your silver gear just yet.\nShore-based anglers should try Ship and Bird creeks, which will have small numbers of silvers trickling in until late September. At Ship Creek the best time to catch September silvers appears to be at the start of the outgoing tide. In Bird Creek, sight fishing with eggs or large spinners produces the best catches.\nRemember that the upper reaches of Twentymile, Glacier, and Carmen rivers, an un-named slough on lower Portage Creek, as well as portions of Lower Explorer and Skookum creeks closed to sport fishing July 14. This seasonal closure protects spawning silver salmon. Placer Creek in Bear Valley (near the Whittier tunnel) is closed year-round to salmon fishing, but open year-round to for all other species. Consult the regulation booklet before heading out to fish these areas and know where you are when you’re fishing.\nDepending on the weather, the Campbell Creek silver salmon fishery is a fair try for September. Low, clear water conditions and warm, sunny days often spook the Campbell Creek silvers. Best silver fishing usually happens after rainy weather, when water temperatures drop, and water levels rise. Look for deep holes, and drift your lure or bait through the hole. Most fishing effort takes place downstream of Dowling Blvd. to the Dimond Blvd. bridge.

As the weather cools, lake fishing usually gets better and better, offering an alternative to shoulder-to-shoulder salmon angling. Fall fishing in local stocked lakes can be pretty lonely as effort generally tapers off this time of the year. Fly-fishing from a float tube in local stocked lakes will produce some nice rainbows. Several local lakes are also stocked with Arctic char. To discover what is stocked in local lakes, check our website page containing directions to stocked lakes, bathymetric maps of stocked lakes and the stocking history of each lake. Best baits are usually single salmon eggs or fresh shrimp. Small spinners and flies are also very effective.\nNorthern Pike\nNorthern pike were illegally introduced into Sand, Cheney, Campbell, Otter, and Lower Fire lakes but have been eradicated from all but Lower Fire Lake . There is no limit on pike in the Anchorage area. Along with rod and reel, bow and arrow and spears are legal. If you hunt pike with a bow, the arrow must be attached to the bow. Anglers pursuing pike with rod and reel are encouraged to target pike, but remember, both snagging and wasting pike is illegal. Effective lures include top-water \"poppers\" and \"buzz baits.\" Your best bet for pike in the Anchorage area now is Lower Fire lakes. For some good pike recipes and information on how to filet pike check out the “Pike Page” on our website.\nFolks who are dumping pike into local lakes are a real threat to your recreational fisheries.

Closures are necessary in order to protect spawning fish. Anglers will likely have a hard time catching large halibut because most spawning fish are far offshore along the continental shelf, in 400-600 feet of water.\nAnglers must keep the first two demersal (non-pelagic) rockfish they catch. Non-pelagic rockfish - such as yelloweye, quillback, or copper rockfish - need this additional protection because they have difficulty resubmerging unassisted after they are brought to the surface and experience a change in pressure. Rockfish are extremely long-lived fish, and are slow to reach sexual maturity. Overharvest would quickly reduce the number of mature fish available to spawn. Methods to release rockfish with deepwater release mechanisms have been researched and anglers are encouraged to use these devices. For more information, see the Rockfish Conservation pages.\nSalmon\n\"Winter\" kings may be caught throughout the Sound, and in many near-shore salt waters of Alaska. Also called \"feeder\" kings, they are cruising the Sound, fattening up before returning to their home stream to spawn. Try using downriggers fishing 60 feet or deeper.\nFreshwater Fishing Opportunities\nArea fresh waters should prove fair for Dolly Varden fishing. Try fishing the mouths of freshwater streams, where they empty into the Sound. Good bets are imitations of the salmon lifecycle - eggs, flesh flies - or small silvery spinners or spoons.\nFishing for cutthroat trout should be poor to fair throughout the Sound in the winter months. The bag limit for trout in all waters is 2 trout per day, 2 in possession of which only one per day and in possession may greater than 20 inches in length. All trout over 20 inches retained must be recorded on the harvest recording form of your license and only 2 fish over 20 inches per year may be retained.\nSome nice stocked rainbow trout in the 6-8\" range are caught from Blueberry Lake, Thompson Lake, and Ruth Pond in Valdez. Grayling were historically stocked in Thompson Lake near Valdez and some are still found in lake. Both these aggressive feeders will go after small spinners or flies. Try an egg-sucking leech, Royal Coachman, or bead-headed Prince nymph.\nShellfish\nThe shrimp season does not open until April 15. Subsistence Tanner and king crab fisheries are now allowed in winter months. See Prince William Sound subsistence regulation books for these fishery regulations."

The bag limit for trout in all waters is 2 trout per day, 2 in possession of which only one per day and in possession may greater than 20 inches in length. All trout over 20 inches retained must be recorded immediately and only 2 fish over 20 inches per year may be retained.\nSome nice stocked rainbow trout in the 6-8\" range are caught from Blueberry Lake, Thompson Lake, and Ruth Pond in Valdez. Grayling were historically stocked in Thompson Lake near Valdez and some are still found in the lake. Both of these aggressive feeders will go after small spinners or flies. Try an egg-sucking leech, Royal Coachman, or bead-headed Prince nymph.\nShellfish\nThe shrimp season opens April 15. Shrimp fishing is open until September 15th. Shrimp are primarily found in deep waters and often in inlets that have glacial inputs. Shrimp will begin to move into deeper waters as the fall season progresses."

    "full_text": "May Season\nSalmon\nBy mid- to late May, hatchery-stocked king salmon start to show up in Fleming Spit (Cordova area). Look for these king runs to build through the month of May, and peak in mid-June. Anglers looking for fresh king salmon also often have success trolling for \"feeder\" kings. Red salmon also begin to make their appearance by mid-May in locations such as the Eyak River (Cordova) and Main Bay (western Sound).\nGroundfish\nWhen the weather cooperates, early to mid-May can see some nice halibut catches in the 20- 30-pound range throughout the Sound. Larger fish are usually found nearer the end of May. Weather permitting; larger boats often target halibut in ocean entrances of the Sound near Hinchinbrook Entrance and Montague Straits. Nearer to home ports: Passage Canal, Wells Passage, Knowles Head are popular places to jig. Remember, it is illegal to fish for, or harvest, lingcod until July 1. All lingcod incidentally caught must be landed only by hand or with a landing net and released immediately. Fishing for rockfish is also good in May. From May 1-Sept. 15, the limits are 4 rockfish per day/ 8 in possession, of which no more than 2 per day/ 2 in possession may be non-pelagic rockfish. Anglers must retain the first two non-pelagic rockfish they catch and ADF&G recommends the use of a deepwater release mechanism to release rockfish an angler is unable to keep rather than releasing them at the surface. For more information on deepwater release, see the Rockfish Conservation pages.\nResident Fish\nOpportunities in May for Dolly Varden should be good throughout Prince William lakes and streams, especially at ice-out. Try a dry fly at the water's edge, or casting a lure with some silver flash to imitate salmon fry and smolt. Sport Fish Division stocks rainbow trout catchables in Blueberry Lake, Thompson Lake, and Ruth Pond near Valdez. Grayling were also historically stocked in Thompson Lake and can still be found in the lake. Fishing for cutthroat trout is closed from April 15- June 14 to protect spawning fish.\nShellfish\nFishing for shrimp opens on April 15, and catches are highly variable depending on location fished. Clamming is generally good throughout the Sound. A free permit is required before razor clamming near Cordova.\r\nManagement and Research Programs\nStarting in late May, the Division of Sport Fish will continue its port sampling program in the Valdez and Whittier harbors. The information you provide is used to manage the fisheries for the maximum benefit of increasing numbers of users. Contact Barbi Failor in Homer at 235-1731 for additional information."

    "full_text": "June Season\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing generally improves in mid-June, and when the weather cooperates, good fishing can be found in the waters around Hinchinbrook Entrance, Montague Strait, and outside of Montague Island. However, small boat anglers can obtain decent catches closer to port. Out of Whittier, good catches can be made in Port Wells and out to Lone Island. Valdez anglers in small boats typically fish the northeast part of the sound, including Jack Bay, Galena Bay, Port Fidalgo, Knowles Head, and Bligh Reef. Orca Bay and the north side of Hinchinbrook Island provide good fishing for Cordova anglers.\nThe city of Valdez sponsors a halibut derby. Check with the city's Chamber of Commerce for details.\nSalmon\nBy early June, hatchery stocked king salmon should be showing up in Cordova and Valdez. By mid-June, catches at Fleming Spit in Cordova are very good on the rising tides. Also by mid-June, hatchery returns should be good in Valdez. These runs are over by the end of June. Successful anglers cast hardware or drift salmon eggs with a bobber a couple of hours before the peak high tide. Sockeye begin moving up the Copper River in early June, but haven't spread into the systems off the Copper River Highway by then. Look for these fish to enter the streams by mid-June. The fly-fishing area at the mouth of Eyak Lake is good spot to try. Mid-June on the western side of the Sound sees sockeye returning in good numbers to Main Bay and the Coghill system.\nChum salmon fishing near Lake Bay on the southern end of Esther Island, and in Passage Canal and Wells Passage is very good in early to mid-June.\nPink salmon return by mid-June, and excellent fishing is usually reported from Valdez by then.\nOther Saltwater Fishing Opportunities\nLingcod fishing remains closed until July 1. All lingcod incidentally caught must be landed only by hand or with a landing net and released immediately.\nRockfish fishing remains good in June. From May 1-Sept. 15, the limit is 4 rockfish per day/ 8 in possession, of which no more than 2 per day/ 2 in possession may be non-pelagic species. Anglers must retain the first two non-pelagic rockfish they catch. Additional protection is needed for non-pelagic species because of their extreme longevity and low productivity. The use of a deepwater release mechanism  is highly recommended to release rockfish that can’t be kept. Halibut anglers are strongly encouraged to fish with a single large hook (size 16 or larger) and avoid rocky areas to minimize their unintentional rockfish catch. Anglers targeting rockfish are encouraged to fish for black or dusky rockfish in waters less than 10 fathoms (60 feet) to minimize mortality of released fish.\nThe daily bag limit for sharks is one fish of any species, and the annual limit is two sharks of any species. The exception is spiny dogfish. The daily bag/possession limit for spiny dogfish is 5 fish and there is no annual limit. Sleeper sharks are generally considered inedible and should be released. All sharks have high urea content, and are inedible unless handled properly. Bleed your shark immediately upon capture by cutting the underside of the tail, and let the bleeding continue until the heart stops. Gutting the fish with a single cut from the anus to the gills can enhance the quality of the meat. Please do not cut off the head or tail until after the fish is landed to ensure that ADF&G port samplers have an opportunity to obtain measurements.\nThe Division of Sport Fish collects data from the recreational bottomfish fishery in the Whittier and Valdez boat harbors. Fishery technicians interview returning anglers and sample halibut, rockfish, and sharks for length, weight, sex, and age statistics. You can help by providing information when interviewed and by returning fish carcasses to the harbor for sampling by the technicians. Information collected by this project is used to monitor the health of the fishery, advise halibut management agencies, and help the Board of Fisheries formulate regulations that protect fish stock and provide maximum fishing opportunity. Contact Barbi Failor in Homer (235-1731) for additional information.\nBy mid-June, the herring show up at the Valdez City Dock, and anglers can be found jigging small strands of multiple hooks.\nFresh Waters\nIn June, opportunities for Dolly Varden are good to fair throughout Prince William. Dolly fishing should become excellent as Dollies follow the salmon into the lakes and streams. Try targeting Dollies by presenting them with a dry fly at the water's edge, or casting a lure with some silver flash to imitate salmon fry and smolt.\nThe Sport Fish Division stocks rainbow trout in Blueberry Lake, Thompson Lake, and Ruth Pond near Valdez. Grayling were also historically stocked in Thompson Lake.\nOnly artificial, unbaited lures may be used in fresh waters until June 15. Also, fishing for cutthroat trout is closed from April 15- June 14 to protect spawning trout. Once fishing opens June 15, fishing should be good throughout the Sound. The bag limit for trout in all waters is 2 trout per day, 2 in possession of which only one per day and in possession may be greater than 20 inches in length, all trout over 20 inches retained must be recorded immediately and only 2 fish over 20 inches per year may be retained.\nShellfish\nShrimp fishing is open until September 15th.

    "full_text": "July Season\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing generally continues to be good in July. When the weather cooperates, anglers can venture out to Hinchinbrook Entrance, Montague Strait, and the far side of Montague Island for the best halibut fishing. Small boat anglers can obtain decent catches closer to port, but with success rates are often lower. Out of Whittier, good catches can be made in Port Wells and out to Lone Island. Valdez anglers in small boats typically fish the northeast part of the Sound, including Jack Bay, Galena Bay, Port Fidalgo, Knowles Head, and Bligh Reef. Orca Bay and the north side of Hinchinbrook Island provide good fishing for Cordova anglers.\nSalmon\n\"Feeder\" king salmon can be caught around Cordova and Whittier using downriggers fishing 60 feet or deeper. The hatchery runs to Whittier and Cordova tail off by the first week of July.\nAlso in July, red salmon (sockeye) move up the Copper and Bering Rivers in strong numbers, and start to spread into the tributaries off the Copper River Highway. The fly-fishing only area at the mouth of Eyak Lake is good spot to try in early to mid-July. Anglers also have success fishing from boats in Eyak River. Good sockeye catches are also reported from the western part of the Sound, and from Whittier. Anglers target the Coghill system, as well as Main Bay.\nChum salmon show a strong return to Lake Bay Hatchery on the southern end of Ester Island in early July, and a few show up in systems like Hartney Bay out of Cordova. Chum runs are pretty much done by mid-July.\nPink salmon begin their return in early to mid-July, with the run peaking by mid- to late July on the eastern side of the Sound, and early to mid-August on the western side. Pinks caught in saltwater are bright and feisty, not the tired \"humpies\" of freshwater fame. Good places near Valdez to try are Jack Bay and Allison Point. In the eastern part of the Sound, strong pink returns come into Sheep and Simpson bays near Cordova. Out of Whittier, anglers catch pinks in Wells Passage, Port Wells, and the entrance to Eaglek Bay. Try offering them a pink or orange Pixie.\nThe much-anticipated silver salmon run begins by the beginning of the second week of July. This early, most of the bright, fat silvers are still out near Bligh Island, but they move in closer to shore as July progresses. In mid-July, in the Valdez area, anglers catch silvers in Jack Bay, Blackstone Point, Sawmill Bay, down through Bligh Reef, and, once the run gets going, right outside the city dock. In the western Sound, silver anglers try their luck around the Coghill system. Out of Whittier, anglers will mooch and troll for silvers around Ester Island and down to Eshamy.\nThere are some salmon \"terminal harvest areas\" in Prince William Sound, where bag limits are more liberal. Check the regulation booklet for a description of these areas.\nOther Saltwater Fishing Opportunities\nLingcod fishing opens July 1, but special restrictions remain in effect. The limit in Prince William Sound waters east of Cape Puget is two fish daily (four in possession). All lingcod must be at least 35 inches in total length, or 28 inches with the head removed. Gaffs can not be used on fish that are released.\nRockfish fishing remains good in July. From May 1-Sept. 15, the limit is 4 rockfish per day/ 8 in possession, of which no more than 2 per day/ 2 in possession may be non-pelagic species.

    "date": "Aug",
    "full_text": "August Season\nAugust still sees plenty of pink salmon action throughout Prince William Sound. Jumpers can be seen nearly everywhere and good catches come in from Sheep and Simpson bays out of Cordova. Allison Point in Valdez is a popular place for shore anglers in early to mid-August. Later in the month, a few large bright fish can still be caught trolling from Valdez out to the Narrows. Out of Whittier, August anglers catch pinks in Wells Passage, Port Wells, and the entrance to Eaglek Bay.\nPinks will wind down around the third week of August, just about time for the silver salmon fishing to heat up. Valdez has hatchery-enhanced runs returning in mid-August. Valdez anglers anxious for early bright, feisty silvers should try Anderson Bay, Shoup Bay, and Gold or Mineral creeks. Silver salmon anglers can also try the mouths of Galena and Jack bays, Pt. Freemantle, Busby Island, and the Anderson waterfall. Allison Point in late August is a good place to be for excellent silver action. The City of Valdez sponsors a silver salmon derby in late July through Sept. Call the Valdez Convention & Visitor's Bureau for more information at (907) 835-4636, or check their website at www.valdezalaska.org.\nOn the western side of the Sound, look for silvers in Port Wells, near Esther Island, the Dutch Group islands, and Perry Island. Whittier anglers target Wells Passage, Pigot Bay, Culross Passage, and Decision Point. Shore-based anglers must wait until the last week of August for silvers to arrive in the Whittier harbor.\nIn Cordova, look for silvers around mid-August at the mouth of the Eyak River, and in Orca Inlet, with the run peaking in early September. Silvers that have been stocked return to Fleming Spit around mid-August and peak in early September.\nGeneral salmon bag limits for pink and chum salmon are 6 per day/ 12 in possession. Other species and some areas have area-specific limits so look at the regulation book before fishing for salmon.\nIn almost all marine and fresh waters of Prince William Sound only 3 per day and 3 in possession may be silver salmon. However, the following 5 areas have \"special\" silver salmon regulations, and some we define as \"Terminal Harvest\" areas. Both these special areas have the following bag/possession limits for salmon 16\" or longer (other than kings):\n\nShelter Bay: 6 per day/12 in possession, only 1 silver salmon allowed.\nCordova area: 6 per day/12 in possession, all salmon may be silvers\nWhittier area: 6 per day/12 in possession, all salmon may be silvers\nValdez area: 6 per day/12 in possession, all salmon may be silvers\nChenega area: 6 per day/12 in possession, all salmon may be silvers.\n\nFor specific descriptions of these areas, check the Southcentral sport fishing regulation booklet. \"I didn't know\" is not considered a legal excuse.\nSockeye (red) salmon also provide some saltwater opportunity in Prince William Sound in early and mid-August, but taper off quickly by the end of August. Good places to target sockeye are on the western side of the Sound in Eshamy and Main bays. The Coghill system, in Port Wells, may also produce fair sockeye fishing in early August.\nA few feeder king salmon can be picked up around Valdez, Cordova, and Whittier. Try using downriggers fishing 60 feet or deeper. You may keep only 2 king salmon per day and have only 2 in possession as part of your total salmon bag limits.\nChum salmon are also available in streams throughout the Sound, around Esther Island, and systems like Hartney Bay out of Cordova usually produce some nice catches.\nSaltwater Fishing Opportunities\nNice weather and hard fishing during the early part of August can bring in some good halibut catches. Montague Island, Wessels Reef out in the Gulf, Seal Rocks, Channel Island off Green Island, and the Hinchinbrook Lighthouse area often bring in good-sized fish. A bit closer to Valdez, anglers land nice-sized halibut from Jack and Sawmill bays, Bligh Reef, and Middle Rock. On the western side of the Sound, try fishing in Port Wells; off Coghill Point; in Eaglek, Long, or Pigot bays; and around the Dutch Group islands. Lingcod fishing remains open with special restrictions in effect. The limit in Prince William Sound waters east of Cape Fairfield is two fish daily (four in possession). All lingcod must be at least 35 inches in length, and fish that are released cannot be gaffed.\nRockfish fishing should remain good. Until Sept. 15 the limit is 4 rockfish per day (8 in possession) of which no more than 2 per day (2 in possession) may be non-pelagic species. Anglers must retain the first two non-pelagic rockfish they catch. Additional protection is needed for non-pelagic species because of their extreme longevity and low productivity.

    "full_text": "September Season\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing typically slows down in September. Many of the adult fish have started their offshore migration, and many anglers turn their attentions to silver salmon during this time, but those who persist may have success. Anglers can expect to catch mostly small halibut inside the Sound, with better fishing in outside waters.\nSalmon\nSilver salmon usually provide plenty of shore-based action through the third week of September. There are large hatchery returns to Valdez shorelines (Allison Point and the Valdez city dock), to Esther Island, to Fleming Spit in Cordova, and to Whittier/Passage Canal. Boat anglers head toward Mineral or Gold creeks in Valdez Arm.\nThere are small wild runs of silvers throughout the Sound. Anglers typically target Port Wells, the Dutch Group islands, and Perry Island. Whittier anglers target Wells Passage, Pigot Bay, Culross Passage, and Decision Point. Cordova anglers head toward the Eyak River and Ibeck Creek.\nAlthough snagging is a legal method in the majority of Prince William Sound salt waters, most silver anglers will be casting medium to heavy spoons or spinners, such as Pixees ™, Vibrax ™, and Tee-Spoons ™. Anglers also like to add a gob of fresh or preserved salmon roe, or a chunk of herring as an extra enticement. Portions of Orca Inlet, and portions of Eshamy Lagoon are closed to snagging: check the regulation booklet closely.\nSalmon \"Terminal Harvest Areas\":\nExcept in 5 areas, salmon bag limits are 6 per day and 12 in possession, of which only 3 per day/3 in possession can be silvers in all marine and fresh waters of Prince William Sound. The 5 areas with different regulations are:\n\nShelter Bay: 6 per day/12 in possession, only 1 silver salmon allowed\nCordova area: 6 per day/12 in possession, all salmon may be silvers\nWhittier area: 6 per day/12 in possession, all salmon may be silvers\nValdez area: 6 per day/12 in possession, all salmon may be silvers\nChenega area: 6 per day/12 in possession, all salmon may be silvers\n\nBefore you throw a line in the water, check the Southcentral regulations for an exact description of these waters and which areas are open to the larger bag limits.\nSockeye (red), pink, and chum salmon runs are pretty much over by early September. Now's the time to start planning next year's trip.\nA few feeder king salmon can be picked up around Cordova and Whittier. Try using downriggers fishing 60 feet or deeper.\nOther Saltwater Fishing Opportunities\nLingcod fishing remains open, and special restrictions remain in effect. The limit in Prince William Sound waters east of Cape Fairfield is two fish daily (four in possession). All lingcod must be at least 35 inches in total length, or 28 inches with the head removed. Gaffs cannot be used to land fish that are released.\nRockfish fishing remains good in September, when boats can brave the weather and leave port. Until Sept. 15, the limit is 4 rockfish per day/ 8 in possession, of which no more than 2 per day/ 2 in possession may be non-pelagic species. After Sept. 15, the daily limit is 8 per day/8 in possession, of which no more than 2 per day/2 in possession may be non-pelagic species.\nAnglers must keep the first two non-pelagic rockfish they catch. Additional protection is needed for non-pelagic species because of their extreme longevity, low productivity, and their general inability to successfully submerge to depth. Anglers are encouraged to use deepwater release mechanisms to release rockfish once their limit has been reached. Halibut anglers are strongly encouraged to fish with a single large hook (size 16 or larger) and avoid rocky areas to minimize their unintentional rockfish catch. Anglers targeting rockfish are encouraged to fish for black or dusky rockfish in waters less than 10 fathoms (60 feet) to minimize mortality of released fish.\nSome sharks, particularly spiny dogfish, are likely to be caught throughout September. The daily bag limit for sharks is one fish of any species, and the annual limit is two sharks of any species. The exception is spiny dogfish. The daily bag/possession limit for spiny dogfish is 5 fish and there is no annual limit. Sleeper sharks are generally considered inedible and should be released. All harvested sharks must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record. All sharks have high urea content, and are inedible unless handled properly. Bleed your shark immediately upon capture by cutting the underside of the tail, and let the bleeding continue until the heart stops. Then gut the fish with a single cut from the anus to the gills and remove all entrails to enhance the quality of the meat.\nThe Division of Sport Fish collects data from the recreational bottomfish fishery in the Whittier and Valdez boat harbors only through the first week of September. Information collected through catch sampling will be summarized in reports for the Alaska Board of Fisheries, the International Pacific Halibut Commission, and the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. Contact Barbi Failor in Homer (235-1731) for additional information.\nFreshwater Fishing Opportunities\nFishing for cutthroat trout should be good throughout the Sound. The bag limit for the Sound is 2 per day and 2 in possession. The bag limit for trout in all waters is 2 trout per day, 2 in possession of which only one per day and in possession may greater than 20 inches in length. All trout over 20 inches retained must be recorded immediately and only 2 fish over 20 inches per year may be retained.\nSeptember opportunities for Dolly Varden are good throughout Prince William, with hungry Dollies following spawning salmon. Try targeting Dollies by presenting them with a dry fly at the water's edge, dead-drifting an egg pattern, or casting a lure with some silver flash to imitate salmon fry and smolt.\nSome nice stocked rainbow trout in the 6-8\" range are caught from Blueberry Lake, Thompson Lake, and Ruth Pond in Valdez. Grayling were historically stocked in Thompson Lake near Valdez. Both these aggressive feeders will go after small spinners or flies. Try an egg-sucking leech, Royal Coachman, or bead-headed Prince Nymph.\nShellfish\nThe shrimp season closes Sept. 15 for the rest of the year.

    "full_text": "October through November Season\nHalibut, Rockfish, Lingcod\nSaltwater fishing usually slows down in fall/early winter. Halibut have moved offshore and wintry weather keeps many boats in port. Anglers will likely have a hard time catching large halibut because most are spawning far offshore along the continental shelf, in 400-600 feet of water.\nAlthough the bag limit for rockfish goes up in September, anglers must still keep the first two non-pelagic rockfish they catch. Non-pelagic (demersal) rockfish - such as yelloweye, quillback, and coppers - need this additional protection because they have difficulty resubmerging unassisted after they are brought to the surface and experience a change in pressure. Rockfish are extremely long-lived fish, and are slow to reach sexual maturity. Overharvest would quickly reduce the number of mature fish available to spawn.\nLingcod fishing remains open through December 31, and special restrictions remain in effect. The limit in Prince William Sound waters east of Cape Fairfield is two fish daily (four in possession). All lingcod must be at least 35 inches in length, or 28 inches with the head removed. Gaffs cannot be used to land fish that are released. Throughout the fall and early winter, lingcod congregate in nearshore waters in preparation for spawning.\nSalmon\n\"Winter\" kings may be caught throughout the Sound, and in many near-shore salt waters of Alaska. Also called \"feeder\" kings, they are cruising the Sound, fattening up before returning to their home stream to spawn. Try using downriggers fishing 60 feet or deeper.\nSilver salmon continue to be available in October in the Coghill area, and near the Whittier docks. The Cordova road system is also worth a try if you're already in the area.\nFreshwater Fishing Opportunities\nArea fresh waters should prove fair for Dolly Varden fishing. Try fishing the mouths of freshwater streams, where they empty into the Sound. Good bets are imitations of the salmon lifecycle - eggs, flesh flies - or small silvery spinners or spoons.\nFishing for cutthroat trout should be good throughout the Sound. The bag limit for trout in all waters is 2 trout per day, 2 in possession of which only one per day and in possession may greater than 20 inches in length. All trout over 20 inches retained must be recorded immediately and only 2 fish over 20 inches per year may be retained.\nSome nice stocked rainbow trout in the 6-8\" range are caught from Blueberry Lake, Thompson Lake, and Ruth Pond in Valdez. Grayling were historically stocked in Thompson Lake. Both these aggressive feeders will go after small spinners or flies.

Subsistence Tanner and king crab fisheries are now allowed in winter months. See Prince William Sound subsistence regulation books for these fishery regulations.\nOctober November\nHalibut, Rockfish, Lingcod\nSaltwater fishing usually slows down in fall/early winter. Halibut have moved offshore and wintry weather keeps many boats in port. Anglers will likely have a hard time catching large halibut because most are spawning far offshore along the continental shelf, in 400-600 feet of water.\nAlthough the bag limit for rockfish goes up in September, anglers must still keep the first two non-pelagic rockfish they catch. Non-pelagic rockfish - such as \"red snapper\" - need this additional protection because they rarely survive the change in pressure as they are brought to the surface. Rockfish are extremely long-lived fish, and are slow to reach sexual maturity. Overharvest would quickly reduce the number of mature fish available to spawn.\nLingcod fishing remains open through December 31, and special restrictions remain in effect. The limit in Prince William Sound waters east of Cape Puget is two fish daily (four in possession).  All lingcod must be at least 35 inches in length, or 28 inches with the head removed.  Gaffs can not be used to land fish that are released.  Throughout the fall and early winter, lingcod congregate in nearshore waters in preparation for spawning.\nSalmon\n\"Winter\" kings may be caught throughout the Sound, and in many near-shore salt waters of Alaska. Also called \"feeder\" kings, they are cruising the Sound, fattening up before returning to their home stream to spawn. Try using downriggers fishing 60 feet or deeper.\nSilver salmon continue to be available in October in the Coghill area, and near the Whittier docks. The Cordova road system is also worth a try if you're already in the area.\nFreshwater Fishing Opportunities\nArea fresh waters should prove fair for Dolly Varden fishing. Try fishing the mouths of freshwater streams, where they empty into the Sound. Good bets are imitations of the salmon lifecycle - eggs, flesh flies - or small silvery spinners or spoons.\nFishing for cutthroat trout should be good throughout the Sound. The bag limit for trout in all waters other than the Special Management Area is 2 trout per day, 2 in possession of which only one per day and in possession may greater than 20 inches in length, all trout over 20 inches retained must be recorded immediately and only 2 fish over 20 inches per year may be retained.\nSome nice stocked rainbow trout in the 6-8\" range are caught from Blueberry Lake and Ruth Pond in Valdez. Grayling are stocked in Thompson Lake near Valdez. Both these aggressive feeders will go after small spinners or flies. Try an egg-sucking leech, Royal Coachman, or bead-headed Prince Nymph.\nAnglers are also reminded that the Copper River Delta \"Special Management Area for Trout\" has been established to protect unique stocks of trout east of the Copper River. Check the regulations for special restrictions and a description of the area.\nShellfish\nThe shrimp season does not open until April 15. Subsistence Tanner and king crab fisheries are now allowed in winter months.  See Prince William Sound subsistence regulation books for these fishery regulations."

(Neither the ADF&G Permanent ID license nor the ADF&G Disabled Veteran's license expire.)\nThe sport fishing regulations are good through April 15 of the new year. Look for new booklets around March or early April.\nBy mid-February of the new year, look for our Pre-season Management Outlook. We'll post it on our web site as soon as it is completed and approved.\nAlso by that time, we'll have a draft of the Bristol Bay Commercial Services Provider list. This list includes lodges, accommodations, guides, equipment rental, air taxis, other government agency offices, Native Corporation offices, and map sources. Although it's not a complete directory of every sport fishing-related business, it's pretty thorough. We use it to contact businesses and agencies in-season to inform them of news events and regulation changes, but anglers who are planning fishing trips to the Bristol Bay area will also find it useful.\nThe department makes no endorsement of any business. The information in the Commercial Services Provider list is given to us in response to a department questionnaire. The list usually finalized for the season in April /May.\nRainbow Trout, Dolly Varden/Arctic Char, Grayling, Smelt, Northern Pike\nResident fish continue to present the main sport fishing opportunity in winter. Fishing for rainbows, Dollies, grayling can be fair to very good where open water can be found, or through the ice. Typical ice fishing techniques for trout, Dolly , smelt and pike include jigging and tip-ups. In the darkest and coldest days, success can be minimal, but if a warm spell comes, or in late February as the days grow longer, angler success can be good. For the bigger species, salmon eggs, herring, or big colorful spoons in shades of bright green, red-and-white, or silver are popular. Standby lures include Daredevles®, Krocodiles®, Pixees®, Swedish Pimples® and similar - check with local tackle shops for their recommendations. It is also legal to spear northern pike through the ice. For smelt, use very small lures for jigging. Check regulations carefully for single-hook and fly-fishing-only waters.\nThe ice can be very thick - 4 feet or more in places and a power auger is a real blessing. But hand crank augers and hand chisels can be a great way to get some winter aerobic exercise - just don't overheat and risk getting chilled.\nIce thickness can vary with the weather, especially on the rivers, so always be very careful. Only a few degrees change in the weather can mean several inches difference in ice thickness, especially on the bigger rivers, and especially as the end of winter approaches. What was safe at zero F. or -10° F. may not be safe at +15° F.\nIf you are smelting - which is often done on tidal ice - know the tide schedules and be familiar with your fishing spot.\nIn some winters, or during warm spells, anglers may find open waters in the Bristol Bay area. If it's possible to access these waters safely they may offer some traditional rod and reel angling opportunity. Spoons, spinners, plugs and bait (where legal) are used. Some of the eastern Bristol Bay rivers are the most common opportunities, especially in late February. As usual, be sure to check the regulations before you head out to fish."

This list includes lodges, accommodations, guides, equipment rental, air taxis, other government agency offices, Native Corporation offices, and map sources. Although it's not a complete directory of every sport fishing-related business, it's pretty thorough.

The information in the Commercial Services Provider list is given to us in response to a department questionnaire. The list usually finalized for the season in April /May.\nMost lakes stay ice-covered until mid- to late May, and some of the higher lakes don't thaw until mid- or late June. By late April, river ice is usually melting, at least near inlet and outlets, but may start melting as early as mid-March in a warm year. Warm spells and underwater springs may contribute to \"overflow\" - areas of water or slush on top of ice. Look for discolored ice, and walk and drive where others have gone.\nDon't forget good sunglasses and even sun screen for those special bright days. A day on the ice and snow in brilliant sun can cause painful snow blindness and even sunburned faces and ears.\nCheck regulations carefully! Some waters change to single-hook-only March 1. Much of the eastern section and other selected area waters close to ALL fishing April 10 through June 7 in order to protect spawning rainbow trout. Check regulations carefully for seasons, bag and size limits, single-hook and fly-fishing-only waters.\nRainbow Trout, Dolly Varden/Arctic Char, Grayling, Northern Pike, Smelt\nResident fish continue to present the only sport fishing opportunity. Fishing for rainbows, Dollies, grayling and pike may be fair to fabulous as the season warms up and the ice opens. Typical ice fishing techniques for trout and Dolly Varden include jigging and tip-ups. It is also legal to spear northern pike through the ice.\nWhen waters begin to open, rainbows and Dolly Varden/ Arctic Char feed on freshly-hatched fry, insects and early migrating salmon smolt. Fly patterns imitating small fish, alevins, sculpins, minnows, leeches or egg-sucking leeches (black, brown, or purple) may catch fish. Don't overlook the fluorescent oranges, pinks and greens, which often work very well. Where fishing is allowed in April, small plugs like Fat Raps®, Rapalas®, Bombers®, Wiggle Warts® and the like may work well too - colors from those imitating natural fish to red, all white, or even all black can work. Spoons like Pixees®, Krocodiles®, and Daredevles®, and spinners like Mepps®, and Vibrax® in silver, blue and silver, gold, orange, green, or pink can produce fish. Salmon eggs or other baits work where legal.\nThe Naknek River and Kvichak River drainages are the best known early-season bets - but other open waters around the Bay can produce some fishing too.\nSmelt fishing is much more enjoyable in March as the days lengthen and the temperatures rise. Always be careful of the ice. Try very small silver or green spoons and jigs.\nAs the ice melts from pike waters, the fish feed voraciously in preparation for spawning. Anglers may find some good pike opportunities after mid- to late April. Note the bag and size limits for Bristol Bay pike. Plugs imitating small fish, large silver or colorful spoons, and steel leaders are the tickets for pike.\nIn some waters, grayling fishing can be excellent along ice edges. Try standard insect patterns, small (sized 0-2) spinners, and spoons in the standard array of colors."

    "date": "May",
    "full_text": "May Season\nMay is one of the more unsettled times for Bristol Bay-area weather. All the snow and most of the ice can be gone by May 15, or we could have a late winter/early spring snowstorm. Typically, though, May is pretty temperate, especially the third and fourth weeks. By the end of May, daytime temperatures are usually in the 45-60° F. range, and nighttime temperatures in the 30-40° F. range. River ice is usually gone by May 15, and lower-elevation lake ice by May 25 or 30. Higher elevation lakes and the mountains hold onto their snow until mid-June, and unusually warm days will see river levels rise because of snow melt.\nDress in layers to allow for both morning and evening cold and midday warmth. Good rain gear is very useful - as much for a wind breaker as to turn away any cold early season rain.\nAt least this time of year the biting bugs are usually scarce; but it doesn't hurt to bring some repellent - we've seen occasional buggy days on the Naknek even in mid-May.\nGuides - please remember to register before you head to the bush for the season.\nLook for our Pre-season Management Outlook on our web site, in the Anchorage Sport Fish Information Center, or stop by the Dillingham or King Salmon offices for a copy.\nSpecial Regulations on Selected Streams/Lakes\nMany rivers and lakes are closed to all sport fishing until June 8, and some have different limits until June 8. Some rivers are restricted to unbaited, single-hook, artificial lures only, and some are catch-and-release only for rainbow trout. PLEASE CAREFULLY CHECK THE REGULATIONS! The restrictions are in place to protect and conserve rainbow trout.\nKing Salmon\nThe first salmon to arrive, the king (or chinook) salmon, usually show by the end of the fourth week of May but angling success is usually pretty slow.\nBe sure you have your signed king stamp stuck to the back of your sport fishing license BEFORE fishing for king salmon. Anglers who are not required to buy a license must first have a Harvest Record Card before fishing for king salmon, available at license vendors, or at the ADF&G offices. Anglers who MUST have a Harvest Record Card are children under 16 (resident OR non-resident), anglers with the ADF&G Permanent ID Card (senior license) and anglers with the ADF&G Disabled Veteran's License. All other anglers must record their harvest on the back of their fishing license. You will also need a pen with you to record your king salmon harvest immediately.\nNaknek River\nThis system typically sees the first king salmon catches of the year. Normally, the sport fishery will land about 500 fish by mid-June. High numbers of \"jack\" salmon (smaller males under 20 inches) are normal for the Naknek River.\nNushagak River\nIn better seasons, the subsistence nets off the beaches near Dillingham or Clark's Point catch kings by mid- to late May. Sport fishing doesn't produce until the kings get into the freshwater of the Nushagak River two to three weeks later. In poor seasons, fishable numbers of kings tend to occur a little later in the season.\nThere is an annual limit of 4 kings per angler per season of any size in the Nushagak/ Mulchatna River drainage, and other restrictions apply. Check the regulation booklet carefully before going fishing and don't forget to record a harvested king salmon immediately.\nThe Nushagak River drainage king salmon fisheries are guided by the \"Nushagak/Mulchatna Chinook Salmon Management Plan.\" The plan addresses how the subsistence, commercial, and sport fisheries are operated at various escapement levels. Portions of the plan relevant to the sport fishery appear in the regulation booklet. Anglers are encouraged to be familiar with the plan and to be aware that in-season restrictions are likely when the escapement is low.\nOther Salmon\nMay is too early for any sockeye (red), pink, chum, or coho (silver) salmon to return.\nResident Species: Rainbow Trout, Arctic Char/Dolly Varden, Lake Trout, Northern Pike\nReminder: check the regulations before planning your fishing trip. Some rivers do not open to fishing until June 8, some rivers are catch-and-release only, and some have tackle restrictions.\nFor early-season fishing, try Lake Clark, or one of Lake Clark's inlet streams. Stay upstream of Sixmile Lake, though, to avoid fishing in closed waters. Lake Clark has northern pike, Arctic grayling, and lake trout. Try trolling spoons and spinners in the narrows just above Sixmile Lake for lakers.\nThe lower Naknek River (up to Rapids Camp ADF&G marker) also presents some early season opportunity for rainbow trout, Dolly Varden, grayling, pike, and an occasional lost lake trout.\nAnother early season opportunity can be found in the Wood River lakes. As the lakes become ice-free, angling success for Arctic char/Dolly Varden and rainbow trout begins to improve.\nGrayling and Arctic char/Dolly Varden are often found feeding on the out-migrating salmon fry. Sparsely-tied alevin patterns, such as Thunder Creeks, and bead-eyed fry patterns work well. Warm days may produce some insect hatches, especially various size stone flies, caddis and midges so go prepared with some nymphs, wets and dries as well.\nBy late May, the northern pike are spawning and are voracious. If it's legal gear, bring any top-water buzz bait or popper. If lures are not allowed, any large top-water or weedless sinking fly will work. Now's the time to try those exotic-looking mice and duckling imitations! Don't forget steel leaders, and a hook remover will help to avoid those sharp teeth.\nGood places to explore for northerns once the ice has melted are the sloughs between Portage Creek and Ekwok, on the Nushagak River and in the Wood River lakes."

    "full_text": "June Season\nEarly June can be a surprising time in Western Alaska. Some rivers and lakes are wide open, and have been for two weeks or so. Some lakes, though, may still have a lot of ice, making boat traffic difficult. Normal daytime temperatures range from low 40's on a cloudy/ rainy day to mid 60's on a sunny day. Nights are variable, with some dropping into the mid 30's, especially at elevation.\nOnce the weather warms up, so do the bugs. Bring plenty of bug repellent, and head nets with “No See Um” mesh are a good idea too.\nMost of the Kvichak River drainage (including most waters flowing into Iliamna Lake), the whole Alagnak River drainage, and portions of the Naknek River drainage remain closed to all fishing until June 8. Where the water and seasons are open, such as the lower Naknek River and the central and western portions of the area, there are opportunities to hook a nice fish. Rainbow fishing should be good where open. Other resident species like char, grayling, and northern pike usually provide good fishing opportunities. Pike are usually especially hungry at ice-out. Char and Dolly Varden fishing is usually good wherever out-migrating smolt are found.\nAnglers, when visiting any Alaskan small village, please respect the private property and community regulations- a little respect goes a long way to making friends. Please do not fish near subsistence nets - if your hook gets tangled it creates a serious hazard to the owner.\nKing Salmon\nKings begin to show up in early June in the major drainages. Runs build through mid- to late June. The last week of June often sees some excellent king salmon action throughout Bristol Bay drainages. Bristol Bay kings average 20 to 25 pounds, with very few fish exceeding 50 pounds.\nNaknek River\nFishing for king salmon on the Naknek River is just beginning in early June, with fishing improving over the next few weeks. Normally the sport fishery will land about 500 fish during the first few weeks of the season. The marker buoys and signs showing the closed waters around the outlets of King Salmon and Paul's creeks are installed by June 1. The run builds to a mid- to late June peak, with fish available through mid -July.\nNushagak River\nThe king run begins about the second week of June, and peaks the last week of June, with fish availability declining steadily after the first week of July. There is a sonar counter on the Nushagak, and estimates are available from the Dillingham office (907) 842-2427.\nThe normal daily limit is two (2) per day only one of which may exceed 28 inches in length. There is an annual limit of 4 kings per angler per season of any size in the Nushagak/ Mulchatna River drainage, and other restrictions apply. Check the regulation booklet carefully before going fishing.\nThe Nushagak River drainage king salmon fisheries are guided by the “Nushagak/Mulchatna Chinook Salmon Management Plan.” The plan addresses how the subsistence, commercial, and sport fisheries are operated at various escapement levels. Portions of the plan relevant to the sport fishery appear in the regulation booklet. Anglers are encouraged to be familiar with the plan. Open seasons, daily and annual bag limits, legal gear, and waters open to fishing may be changed in-season by Emergency Order to meet objectives of the plan. We recommend calling our recorded hotline at 907-842-7347, checking our Emergency Order website or checking with your favorite Alaskan media outlets for in-season regulation changes before you go fishing.\nAlagnak River and Togiak River\nThe chinook salmon sport fishery in these rivers does not get started until late June and peaks in mid- to late July. The Alagnak kings tend to be a little bigger than fish in other Bristol Bay rivers.\nOther Salmon\nSockeye (red) salmon begin to make their appearance in the Naknek, Kvichak, and Wood rivers by late June. Prime waters to consider by the end of the last week of June are the Egegik River, the Naknek River, the Kvichak River at Igiugig, and possibly the outlet of Ugashik Lake. Better numbers of fish are likely to be available in early to mid-July.\nRemember, hooking these hard-to-catch fish in any place other than the mouth constitutes illegal snagging and requires immediate release of the fish. Officers will be patrolling these fisheries. Anglers headed to the Kvichak River drainage (Igiugig, Newhalen, Lake Clark, etc.) should review the “Kvichak River Sockeye Salmon Management Plan” found in the regulation booklet. This plan guides the department in the management of the sport and subsistence fisheries when escapement projections fall below two million fish.\nChum salmon are a great game fish, particularly on a fly rod. Bring a good #7 or #8 weight rod, some strong size 4 to 2/0 dark purple and pink or salmon marabou flies, and have a ball. Spoons like pink PixeesTM and orange VibraxTM work well for the spin anglers. While it's a little early yet, good bets should be the Nushagak and Togiak rivers.\nCoho and pink salmon do not show up in Bristol Bay sport fisheries during June.\nRainbow Trout\nRainbow trout fishing opens up June 8 in the premier eastern section drainages of Kvichak (Iliamna), Alagnak, and Naknek rivers. Flies and lures that imitate migrating sockeye smolt should work well. Fishing in the early morning and late evening hours will generally produce the best results this time of year. Trout fishing success may decline as sockeye enter the rivers, since spawning salmon provide a lot of food for hungry rainbows.\nAnglers are reminded of the catch-and-release only regulations for rainbow trout fishing in the Kvichak Alagnak (Branch) and Nonvianuk Rivers drainages.\nIn the Naknek River, angling for early rainbow trout is usually good. Anglers are reminded that in the section from Rapids Camp upstream to the lake outlet (Trefon's Cabin), gear is restricted to unbaited single-hook artificial lures with hook gaps of 1/2 inch or less from March 1 through July 31.\nOther good early season bets are the Brooks River, the Kvichak River, Togiak River and the Agulowak and Agulukpak rivers.\nArctic Char/ Dolly Varden\nThere are some excellent opportunities for char in southwest Alaska. These fish are concentrated at stream mouths feeding on out-migrating sockeye salmon smolt and smart anglers will capitalize on that aspect of their life cycle. In most Bristol Bay waters the daily limit is 3 fish with a few more restrictive waters such as the Agulowak River (2/day) and Iliamna River (catch-and-release only). Like the rainbow trout fishery, char success may go down as sockeye salmon plug the rivers.\nArctic Grayling\nIn June, grayling feed on the abundant salmon fry that have emerged from the gravel and are migrating downstream. Sparsely-tied alevin patterns like Thunder Creeks, and bead-eyed fry patterns are often good for grayling at this time of the year. Grayling are an added bonus to the fishing experience in these waters. Spending an afternoon catching grayling on light tackle will add to the fishing trip. Soon after the ice is out, some rivers support abundant spring “runs” of grayling moving up to their spawning and feeding areas. Fishing these waters at the right time can produce some spectacular fishing opportunities.\nNorthern Pike\nThere are bag limits for pike in Western Alaska - check the regulation booklet carefully. Northern pike are a native species waters, and an important subsistence item. Very good pike fishing can be had right after ice-out in the lakes and in the many side sloughs and slow waters of area rivers. Once the weather heats up, pike become inactive during the day. Fishing early morning or late evenings often provides the best success."

    "date": "Jul",
    "full_text": "July Season\nThe Bristol Bay area usually sees nice summer weather in July. Waters clear up, and get back to summer levels. Warmer temperatures bring out the bugs, too, so bring plenty of bug repellent, and head nets with “No See Um” mesh are a good idea, too.\nAnglers, when visiting any Alaskan small village, please respect the private property and community regulations- a little respect goes a long way to making friends. Please do not fish near subsistence nets - if your hook gets tangled it creates a serious hazard to the owner\nBears often move onto salmon-plugged streams as the month progresses. Avoid confrontations by keeping a clean camp. Don't clean your fish in camp, and throw carcasses well into the stream. Don't store food in your sleeping areas, and try to set up the cooking area away from sleeping areas, too. Make plenty of noise traveling through brushy areas.\nEarly July is often the time when the department issues special in-season regulatory actions (Emergency Orders) on fisheries governed by management plans. Anglers are encouraged to contact the Dillingham regulation recorder at 907-842-REGS (7347) to stay apprised of these emergency orders.\nKing Salmon\nThe first weeks of July usually provide good to excellent action throughout Bristol Bay drainages. Bristol Bay kings average 20 to 25 pounds, with very few fish exceeding 50 pounds. Keep in mind that most drainages close to fishing for king salmon (including catch-and-release) by July 31, and most of the Nushagak and Mulchatna drainages close earlier, on July 25. Anglers who enjoy catch-and-release king fishing are encouraged use single hooks with pinched barbs. There is a new regulation to leave king salmon in the water if you plan to release them.\nNaknek River\nThe end of the first week of July typically sees the peak of the king run to the Naknek, with fish available through mid-July. Please pay attention to the marker buoys and signs showing the closed waters around the outlets of King Salmon and Paul's creeks.\nNushagak River\nFish availability declines steadily after the first week of July. There is a sonar counter on the Nushagak, and estimates are available from the Dillingham office at (907) 842-2427.\nThere is an annual limit of 4 kings per angler per season of any size in the Nushagak/ Mulchatna River drainage, and other restrictions apply. Check the regulation booklet carefully before going fishing and don't forget to record a harvested king salmon immediately.\nThe Nushagak River drainage king salmon fisheries are guided by the “Nushagak/Mulchatna Chinook Salmon Management Plan.” The plan addresses how the subsistence, commercial, and sport fisheries are operated at various escapement levels. Portions of the plan relevant to the sport fishery appear in the regulation booklet. Anglers are encouraged to be familiar with the plan. We recommend calling our recorded hotline at 907-842-7347, checking our Emergency Order website or checking with your favorite Alaskan media outlets for in-season regulation changes before you go fishing.\nAlagnak River and Togiak River\nThe chinook salmon sport fisheries in the Alagnak and Togiak rivers normally start slowly the first week of July, and peak by mid-July - a little later than other Bristol Bay waters. As with all other rivers in Bristol Bay, note the 5 king seasonal limit and harvest recording requirements for all anglers. The Alagnak kings tend to be a little bigger than fish in other Bristol Bay rivers.\nOther Salmon\nSockeye (red) salmon are the fish of the month for July. Remember, hooking these hard-to-catch fish in any place other than the mouth constitutes illegal snagging and requires immediate release of the fish. Officers will be patrolling the fisheries. Most runs peak by mid-July, and are pretty much done by the end of July.\nSockeye are usually running in good numbers in the Naknek, Nushagak, Kvichak, and Wood rivers by early July. Prime waters to consider are the Egegik, Naknek, Wood, and Alagnak rivers. The outlet of Becharof Lake, and later in the month, the outlet of Ugashik Lake, can also be good.\nAnglers headed to the Kvichak River drainage (Igiugig, Iliamna, Newhalen, Lake Clark, etc.) should review the “Kvichak River Sockeye Salmon Management Plan” found in the regulation booklet. This plan guides the department in the management of the sport and subsistence fisheries when escapement projections fall below two million fish.\nChum salmon are a great fish, particularly on a fly rod, and are at their most abundant levels by mid-July. Use your #7 or #8 weight rod, some strong size 4 to 2/0 dark purple and pink or salmon marabou flies, and have a great time. Spoons like pink PixeesTM and orange VibraxTM work well for the spin anglers. Good bets should be the Nushagak, Alagnak, and Togiak rivers.\nLook for silver salmon to begin returning by late July. Modest opportunities for coho anglers will be found on the lower Nushagak, Wood, and Naknek rivers. Bright pink or orange lures, like size 2 to 4 Tee-SpoonsTM, PixeesTM, VibraxTM, Hot RodsTM, MeppsTM, polar shrimp patterns, and flash flies all work well on coho salmon. Sometimes chartreuse or yellow-green lures work very well on cohos.\nAnglers planning coho salmon fishing trips should note that the bag limit for coho in the Kvichak River and the Lake Iliamna drainage (excluding the Alagnak River drainage) is 2/day.\nOn even-numbered years, Bristol Bay anglers will find plenty of pink salmon action throughout the area from about mid-July to the end of July. Caught in saltwater, or just after entering freshwater and still bright and silvery, pinks make a great light gear sport fish and provide excellent table fare.\nRainbow Trout\nRainbow trout fisheries are fair to excellent in July. In systems with large salmon runs, success for rainbows may decline as the salmon dominate the waterways. Die-hard 'bow anglers welcome the challenge of enticing a rainbow full of salmon eggs to strike a fly. If you are a catch-and-release angler, please consider putting on single hooks and pinching the barbs. This makes it much easier to release fish unharmed..\nGood places to try are the Naknek River, the Wood River Lakes system, and the Alagnak River. Flies and lures that imitate insects, salmon eggs, or salmon flesh are your best bets. Fishing in the early morning and late evening hours will generally produce the best results this time of year.\nAnglers are reminded that the Board of Fisheries adopted catch-and-release only regulations for rainbow trout fishing in the Alagnak (Branch) and Nonvianuk rivers. In the Naknek River, the section from Rapids Camp upstream to the lake outlet (Trefon's Cabin), gear is restricted to unbaited, single-hook artificial lures with hook gaps of 1/2 inch or less from March 1 through July 31.\nArctic Char/ Dolly Varden and Arctic Grayling\nThere are some excellent opportunities for Dollies and grayling in southwest Alaska. These fish are concentrated at stream mouths feeding on drifting salmon eggs and flesh. In most Bristol Bay waters the daily limit for Dollies is 3 fish with a few more restrictive waters such as the Agulowak River (2/day) and Iliamna River (catch-and-release only).\nResident fish are an added bonus for salmon anglers. Spending an afternoon catching grayling or Dollies on light tackle will add to the fishing trip. Use small (size 0-3) silver and/or orange spinners and spoons, egg imitations, or salmon eggs where allowed. Grayling and some rainbows and Dollies may go for dry flies, bead-headed nymphs, traditional wet flies, and leech imitations.\nLike the rainbow trout fishery, char success may go down as sockeye salmon plug the rivers. It may take more skill and patience to outwit full fish.\nNorthern Pike\nThere are bag limits for pike in Western Alaska - check the regulation booklet carefully. Northern pike are a native species to our waters, and an important subsistence item. Very good pike fishing can be found in the lakes and in the many side sloughs and slow waters of area rivers, especially early morning and late evening hours. Pike fishing usually tapers off by late July."

    "full_text": "August through September Season\nEarly fall in Bristol Bay often starts with mild weather, but don't be fooled. Count on stormy periods with rain, wind, and cool temperatures, especially near the end of August. Nighttime temperatures drop to 32 degrees F. or below by mid-September. By late September, ice forms on smaller still waters. The chilly nighttime temperatures are offset by the fine, sunny days, and early fall anglers often agree that there's no better time to be in Bristol Bay. Be sure to come prepared with top-quality raingear and seam-sealed tents. Also, storms or extended rainy periods may cause river levels to change rapidly.\nUntil we have several hard frosts, bugs continue to be especially ferocious. Fine-meshed head nets and mesh bug jackets are good items to bring. Bug repellent is almost mandatory, in August especially. Check the screens on your tent, too.\nAnglers, when visiting any Alaskan small village, please respect the private property and community regulations and traditions. The respect you show goes a long way to making friends and assuring your return is welcome. Especially be careful around subsistence nets. If your hook gets tangled and broken off, it creates a serious hazard to the owner.\nBears are plentiful along salmon streams in August and early September. Avoid confrontations by keeping a clean camp. Don't clean your fish in camp, and throw carcasses well into the stream. It is wise to camp in open areas whenever possible and avoid camping on bear trails. Don't store food in your sleeping areas, and try to set up the cooking area away from sleeping areas. Make plenty of noise traveling through brushy areas and stay alert. The department has a pamphlet called “Bear Facts” that is helpful for bear country visitors.\nAnglers are encouraged to contact the Dillingham regulation recorder at 907-842-REGS (907 842-7347) to stay apprised of any emergency order restrictions in effect for the sport fisheries.\nSilver Salmon\nSilver (coho) salmon are the “salmon of the month” in Bristol Bay, for both August and September.\r\nThe first silvers usually appear in the first week of August, in the Naknek and Nushagak/Wood rivers. Other systems that may provide early success include the Alagnak and Egegik rivers. By the end of the second week of August, the Naknek, Nushagak/Wood, and Alagnak runs are close to peak. From mid-August to early September, silver fishing peaks in the Togiak and Ugashik rivers. The Egegik and Alagnak rivers may get a second pulse of fish around the end of the third week of August. After that, a few silvers may be found in various Bristol Bay waters until mid-September, though usually in declining numbers.\nSilver salmon runs are notoriously erratic, and anglers planning trips should regularly call the ADF&G Bristol Bay regulation hotline, (907) 842-7347. Management of the Nushagak /Mulchatna drainage silver salmon fishery is governed under the “Nushagak River Coho Salmon Management Plan,” 5 AAC 06.368.\nBright pink or orange lures, like sizes 2 to 4 Tee-Spoons™, Pixees™, Vibrax™, Hot Rods™, and Mepps™ all work well for silvers. Fly anglers cast polar shrimp patterns and flash flies, size 2, 4, or 6. Sometimes chartreuse or yellow-green colors work very well, too.\nAnglers planning silvers salmon fishing trips should note that the bag limit for silvers in the Kvichak River and the Lake Iliamna drainage (excluding the Alagnak River drainage) is 2/day to protect these small stocks.\nOther Salmon\nA few chum salmon continue to be available through the end of the first week of August. Best places to try are the Naknek, Alagnak and Togiak rivers. Chum are a great fish, particularly on a fly rod. Use your #7- or #8-weight rod, some strong sized 2 to 4 dark purple and hot pink or salmon marabou flies, and have a great time. Spoons like pink Pixees™ and orange Vibrax™ work well for the spin anglers.\r\nThe sockeye (red) salmon runs are usually past peak by the first of August but a few late, bright fish may be available in some waters.\nIn even-numbered years, pink (humpy) salmon often provide some angling opportunities during late July and the first week of August in many Bristol Bay drainages. The pink runs are usually past peak by mid-August.\nBy July 31, sport fishing for king salmon is closed by regulation in all Bristol Bay waters. Most of the Nushagak / Mulchatna drainage closes July 25.\nThe ADF&G Office in Dillingham can provide a summary of the fishing season by the end of October. In January or February of the new year, look for our “Pre-season Management Outlook.” Both items are posted on our web site.\nRainbow Trout\nMid-August to mid-September is the premier season for Bristol Bay rainbow trout. The Bristol Bay rainbow lifecycle is very dependent on spawning salmon, because rainbows fatten up in order to survive winter on the loose eggs and flesh of dying salmon. Precise timing of the peak varies considerably among the different waters. Fishing success is often best as the spawning declines and easy food becomes less available.\nDedicated rainbow anglers from around the world come to Bristol Bay seeking the challenge of enticing these big, fat and feisty rainbows - fish at their physical peak - to strike a fly. If you are fishing catch-and-release, please use single hooks, pinch the barbs, and release the fish without removing them from the water. Also, we recommend using stronger gear. A slightly heavier line test minimizes playing time and allows a quick release. These techniques make it much easier to release fish unharmed and available to spawn in spring. Please help us protect this wonderful resource.\nGood places to try are the Naknek River, the Wood River Lakes system, most rivers in the Kvichak River drainage, and the Alagnak River. In early August (or anytime before salmon spawning gets going), rainbows may still take dry flies. The Wood River Lakes and the upper Nushagak River are good places to look for this type of action.\nFlies and lures that imitate insects, leeches, salmon eggs, or salmon flesh are your best bets, with fluorescent orange the top color choice for lure anglers. This time of year, fly anglers rely on Glo Bugs, Iliamna Pinkies, the all-purpose purple egg sucking leech, flesh flies and similar patterns in sizes 6 to 1. Fishing in the early morning and late evening hours will generally produce the best results this time of year.\nA note on tackle regulations: In all Bristol Bay waters, beads must be fixed to the line within 2 inches of the fly, hook, or lure, or be free-sliding on the line/leader. Also, in fly-fishing-only waters, a bead on the line followed by a bare hook is not legal gear. The hook must be some type of fly. This regulation was adopted to reduce injuries to the fish.\nAnglers are reminded that the Board of Fisheries adopted catch-and-release only regulations for rainbow trout fishing in flowing waters of the Alagnak (Branch) and Nonvianuk river drainages. In the Naknek River, the section from Rapids Camp upstream to the lake outlet (Trefon's Cabin), gear is restricted to unbaited, single-hook artificial lures with hook gaps of 1/2 inch or less from March 1 through July 31.\nArctic Char/ Dolly Varden, Arctic Grayling\nThere are excellent opportunities for Dollies and grayling in southwest Alaska. These fish congregate near salmon spawning areas where they feed on drifting salmon eggs and flesh. In most Bristol Bay waters the daily limit for Dollies is 3 fish, although there are a few more restrictive waters, such as the Agulowak River (2/day) and Iliamna River (catch-and-release only).\nSea-run (anadromous) Dolly Varden begin showing in the Togiak River by the second week of August. Look for these runs to peak in mid- to late September.\nSpending an afternoon catching grayling or Dollies on light tackle can make an excellent fishing trip. Use small (size 0-3) silver and/or orange spinners and spoons, egg imitations, or salmon eggs where allowed. Grayling and some rainbows and Dollies may go for dry flies, or traditional wet flies such as bead-headed nymphs and leech imitations.\nLike the rainbow trout fishery, char success may be more difficult during the peak of sockeye salmon spawning. When food is so abundant the fish get picky. It may take more skill and patience to outwit full fish.\nNorthern Pike\nThere are bag limits for pike in Western Alaska - check the regulation booklet carefully. Northern pike are a native species to these waters, and an important subsistence fish. Pike inhabit the lakes and the many side sloughs and slow waters of area rivers. Pike move to deeper waters and become less active in the fall, so fishing can be slow from August until ice-up."

    "title": "Oct - Dec",
    "date": "Oct - Dec",
    "full_text": "October through December Season\nTypical early winter weather includes increasingly colder temperatures, often combined with strong winds, foggy periods, and rain and snow. For hardy anglers, particularly in early October, there may be a few days that are truly enjoyable. Night temperatures may dip to 0° F or below by mid-October, and snow and full winter weather should be expected at any time during these months. Anglers should be equipped for cold to very cold weather. Daylight decreases dramatically during these months and fishing trips may be short forays from warm quarters.\nIn spite of the cold weather, most of the area's big lakes and rivers hold too much heat to freeze quickly. Open water, especially around inlets and outlets, continues to provide some angling opportunity. Later, and as the ice thickens, anglers may enjoy some ice fishing opportunities. However, BE VERY CAREFUL. The new ice, erratic temperatures, and currents make ice unsafe during this time.\nSome Regulation Changes\nIn early October and on the first of November, a number of Bristol Bay area regulations \"switch over\" to different bag limits and legal tackle. Please check the regulation booklet before heading out to fish.\nA note on tackle regulations: beads must be fixed within 2 inches of the fly or lure, or be free-sliding on the line/leader. Also, in fly-fishing-only waters, a bead on the line followed by a bare hook is not legal gear. You must also use some type of fly.\nSilver Salmon\nA few silvers may be found in some Bristol Bay drainages through October. In the eastern section, places to look are the upstream reaches of the Egegik, Ugashik, and Naknek drainages. In the western section, try the Togiak River. The silver runs to the Nushagak/Mulchatna drainages are over by mid-September.\nBright pink or orange lures, like size 2 to 4 Tee-Spoons®, Pixees®, Vibrax®, Hot Rods®, Mepps®, polar shrimp patterns, and flash flies all work well on coho salmon. Sometimes chartreuse or yellow-green lures work very well on cohos.\nAnglers planning coho salmon fishing trips should note that the bag limit for coho in the Kvichak River and the Lake Iliamna drainage (excluding the Alagnak River drainage) is 2/day.\nOther Salmon\nAll other salmon - pink, chum, red, and king - are rarely available after August. King salmon should start running again in late May.\nIn January or February of the new year, look for our \"Pre-season Management Outlook.\"\nRainbow Trout, Dolly Varden/Arctic Char, Grayling\nResident fish dominate the scene in late fall and early winter. Fishing for rainbows, and Arctic char/ Dolly Varden can be good to fabulous until it's too cold to fish. By October, the fish are no longer feeding on salmon eggs or salmon carcasses and they can be hungry for anything that looks like food. Try orange spinners and spoons, dead egg patterns, egg-sucking leeches, flesh flies, other imitations of the salmon lifecycle, and bait (where permitted). Try switching back to insect imitations, both wet and dry, and forage fish imitations like sculpins, muddlers minnows, or silver or bronze spoons, plugs or spinners. Fishing in the mid-morning or warmer afternoon hours may produce the best results this time of year - and its much easier on angler and gear.\nGood places to try for rainbow trout are the Naknek River, the Wood River Lakes system, and the Alagnak River. The Kvichak/Iliamna tributaries are excellent prospects if the cold weather doesn't prevent access. The Kvichak River near the community of Igiugig, and the Newhalen River near Iliamna are two of the most accessible fishing opportunities this time of year. Trolling the open waters near the outlets of the larger area lakes can produce nice rainbows. Try Canadian Wonders® or similar spoons. In the central section, rainbows in the Wood River Lakes may be caught well into October, sometimes on dry flies.\nThere are also some excellent opportunities for Dolly Varden/Arctic Char and Arctic grayling in most of the rainbow trout waters listed above. Sea-run (anadromous) Dolly Varden begin showing in the Togiak rivers by the late August, peak in September, and may occasionally still be found into October.\nIn most Bristol Bay waters the daily limit for Dollies is 3 fish with a few more restrictive waters such as the Agulowak River (2/day) and Iliamna River (catch-and-release only).\nWhere they occur in Bristol Bay, this time of year may find a few lake trout near the surface and in near shore waters, providing a special treat for the hardy angler.\nRemember the Bristol Bay tackle restrictions regarding the use of beads. Beads must be fixed within 2 inches of the fly or lure, or be free-sliding on the line/leader. Also, in fly-fishing-only waters, a bead on the line followed by a bare hook is not legal gear. You must also use some type of fly.\nAnglers are reminded that the Board of Fisheries adopted catch-and-release only regulations for rainbow trout fishing in the Alagnak (Branch) and Nonvianuk Rivers.\nThere are bag limits for northern pike in Western Alaska - check the regulation booklet carefully. Northern pike are a native species to our waters, and an important subsistence fish. Pike angling is usually pretty slow this time of year, though it can be a popular time for net fishing by some Nushagak River subsistence fishers.\nBy late November, we have enough ice for ice fishing. Smelt, Arctic char / Dolly Varden, pike, rainbow trout, burbot, and lake trout may be taken through the ice with bait or by jigging lures. BE CAREFUL on the new ice."

(Neither the ADF&G Permanent ID license nor the ADF&G Disabled Veteran's license expire.)\nThe sport fishing regulations are good through April 15 of the new year. Look for new booklets around the end of March or early April.\nSaltwater\nHalibut fishing is closed Jan. 1 through Jan. 31, and lingcod fishing outside of Resurrection Bay is closed Jan. 1 through June 30, to protect spawning and nest-guarding adults. Lingcod fishing in Resurrection Bay north of a line between Cape Resurrection and Aialik Cape is closed year round. All lingcod incidentally caught must be landed by hand or with a landing net and released immediately.\nOtherwise, when weather permits, hardy anglers may find a few rockfish and smaller halibut.\nAnglers leaving from Seward should review the rockfish regulations before heading out. The latitude of Cape Puget is the dividing line between two areas that have different rockfish regulations: 1) Prince William Sound, and 2) The North Gulf Coast (which includes Resurrection Bay).\nIn Prince William Sound, anglers must keep the first two non-pelagic rockfish they catch. Daily limits for rockfish, including non-pelagic rockfish are also different in the two areas.\nNon-pelagic rockfish – such as “red snapper” – need this additional protection because they rarely survive the change in pressure as they are brought to the surface. Rockfish are extremely long-lived fish, and are slow to reach sexual maturity. Overharvest would quickly reduce the number of mature fish available to spawn. Anglers targeting rockfish are encouraged to fish for black or dusky rockfish in waters less than 10 fathoms (60 feet) so that fish that are released have a fair chance at survival. Also, halibut anglers are strongly encouraged to fish with a single large hook (size 16 or larger) and avoid rocky areas to minimize their unintentional rockfish catch. There’s a handy rockfish ID chart posted on the web, and also printed in our regulation booklet.\nSharks are occasionally taken in Resurrection Bay fisheries. The daily bag limit for sharks is one fish of any species, and the annual limit is two sharks of any species. This includes spiny dogfish as well as salmon and sleeper sharks. Sleeper sharks are generally considered inedible and should be released. All harvested sharks must be recorded immediately upon capture on the back of your license or on your Harvest Record Card.\nSharks have a high urea content, and are inedible unless handled properly. Bleed your shark immediately upon capture by cutting the underside of the tail, and let the bleeding continue until the heart stops. Gutting the fish with a single cut from the anus to the gills can enhance the quality of the meat.\nBag limits “carry over” between areas, and daily limits apply per day, NOT PER AREA. For example, if you keep 2 red snapper (non-pelagic rockfish) east of Cape Puget, then travel west of Cape Puget and stop to fish, you are over your daily limit, because west of Cape Puget the daily limit for non-pelagic rockfish is 1. You may pass through an area on your way back to port, but check the limits if you’re thinking about stopping to fish.\nSmall numbers of silver salmon continue to return through the month of October. Try fishing the breakwater near the Seward Small Boat Harbor. Anglers trolling in Resurrection Bay also have a slight chance of picking up a chum salmon or sockeye (red) salmon. The daily bag limits in saltwater for salmon (other than kings) is six.\n“Winter” kings may be caught throughout the North Gulf Coast area, and in many nearshore salt waters of Alaska. Also called “feeder” kings, they are cruising the ocean, fattening up before returning to their home stream to spawn. Try using downriggers in at least 60 feet of water, especially near schools of baitfish.\nA king salmon stamp IS required before fishing for kings (unless you have the ADF&G Permanent ID Card or the ADF&G Disabled Veteran’s Card, or you are under 16 years old). Kings caught in the North Gulf Coast/Resurrection Bay do not need to be recorded on the back of the license or on the harvest record card.\nShellfish\nNorth Gulf Coast is closed to all crabbing due to low population levels. The personal use shrimp pot fishery does not open until April 15.\nFresh Water Fishing Opportunities\nIn early October, anglers may find a silver salmon or two in the open portion of Resurrection River, which is the only Resurrection Bay fresh water drainage open to salmon fishing. Consult your regulation booklet for details.\nMost Resurrection Bay freshwater lakes and streams are open year round to Dolly Varden, rainbow trout, lake trout, and Arctic grayling sport fishing, although fishing success declines dramatically in winter. There are several lakes and streams in the Seward area accessible by road or trail that support resident fish populations. A free handout outlining sport fishing opportunities in the Seward area is available at your local ADF&G office, or on the Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Brochures page.\nBy December, the ice on the smaller lakes is usually thick enough for safe travel (6” for foot traffic, 12” for vehicle). Ice conditions are extremely variable from year to year. Some years, there is open water all winter. On other years, however, there can be 3 feet of ice, especially near shore. Drill or chop test holes before going out too far on any ice-covered waterway.\nTravel on the ice is at your own risk. ADF&G does not monitor ice thickness."

Also called \"feeder\" kings, they are cruising the ocean, fattening up before returning to their home stream to spawn. Try using downriggers at least 60 feet down, especially near schools of baitfish.\nHatchery-released king salmon start returning to Resurrection Bay in April, with first catches coming from the Rugged Island/Fox Island area. These king salmon are returning to two release sites, Lowell Creek and the Seward Lagoon outflow. Lucky beach anglers start to catch a few kings at these two locations in early May.\nIn the marine waters inside Resurrection Bay, from May 1 through August 31, the daily limit for king salmon is two, any size. During the rest of the year inside this area, and in the rest of the North Gulf Coast marine waters, the daily bag and possession limit for king salmon is one fish. A king salmon stamp IS required before fishing for kings (unless you have the ADF&G Permanent ID Card or the ADF&G Disabled Veteran's Card, or you are under 16 years old).\nAnglers trolling in Resurrection Bay also have a slight chance of picking up a chum salmon or red (sockeye) salmon.\nRemember that almost all Resurrection Bay fresh waters are closed year-round to salmon fishing. Fresh waters are separated from salt waters at a line drawn from bank to bank across the creek/stream mouth at mean low tide, or at a point marked by ADF&G.\nResurrection Bay is a “Terminal Harvest Area” for silver salmon, and bag limits are more liberal. Please consult the regulation booklet.\nOther Saltwater Fishing Opportunities\nLingcod fishing in Resurrection Bay, north of a line between Cape Resurrection and Aialik Cape, is closed year-round, and lingcod fishing in all other waters does not open until July 1.

Herring are used as both a food fish and a baitfish. There is no bag limit.\nHooligan (eulachon/smelt) are caught while returning to spawn in the Resurrection River. There's no limit on hooligan.\nIf you're an Alaska resident, you can use a dip net or a small gill net to take hooligan and herring. Check the regulation booklet for net seasons and size limits.\nShellfish\nNorth Gulf Coast is closed to all crabbing year-round, due to low population levels. A section of the North Gulf Coast, from Aialik Cape to Gore Point, is open to shrimping from April 15 through September 15. A free permit is required, and this shrimp fishery is open only to Alaska residents. Please see the Southcentral Alaska shellfish regulations for more information.\nFresh Water Fishing Opportunities\nWith one exception, all fresh waters draining into Resurrection Bay are closed to salmon fishing year-round.

(Neither the ADF&G Permanent ID license nor the ADF&G Disabled Veteran's license expire.)\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing in the Seward area is generally fair in the month of May. Most fish are in the 20-30 pound range. Catches of larger fish are dependent on the weather. If boats can safely leave Resurrection Bay and head east toward Cape Puget, Montague Strait, Cape Cleare, or Elrington Island, they may come back with one or two halibut in the 100-pound range. Anglers fishing from smaller boats occasionally have success in the deeper waters of Resurrection Bay.\nDaily limit is 2 per person, and possession limit is 4 per person. If you hook a fish, it counts toward your limit, regardless of who reels it in.\nSalmon\nBy late April to early May, the first returning king salmon are usually landed from anglers fishing from boats near the mouth of Resurrection Bay. Try trolling near Cape Resurrection, Aialik Cape, or in Eldorado Narrows. Herring under a flasher works well. Look for schools of baitfish, or flocks of birds feeding off baitfish, and cast or troll near there.\nA few kings \"hit the beach\" near the Seward Lagoon outfall culverts, and near the Lowell Creek waterfall, since that's where they are stocked. During May this beach fishery will be slow, but should pick up as the month progresses. The run peaks in mid- to late June. Shore anglers usually have the highest harvest rates fishing 1-2 hours before and after high tide.\nKings can be taken using a variety of lures and bait, as well as by snagging, which is legal in Resurrection Bay salt waters. Anglers also have success trolling for kings near these locations, using herring as bait, and setting a flasher above the lure.\nInside Resurrection Bay, from May 1 – August 31, the daily limit for king salmon is two, any size. A king salmon stamp IS required before fishing for kings (unless you have the ADF&G Permanent ID Card or the ADF&G Disabled Veteran's Card, or you are under 16 years old). Outside Resurrection Bay the bag and possession limit for king salmon, year round, is 1 fish, any size.\nAnglers trolling in Resurrection Bay in May also have a slight chance of picking up a chum salmon or red (sockeye) salmon.\nOther Saltwater Fishing Opportunities\nThere's a chance that shore anglers near Lowell Point will catch an anadromous Dolly Varden or two in mid- to late May. This is a fun surfcasting opportunity, using small spinners and spoons or flies that imitate salmon fry and smolt.\nLingcod fishing inside Resurrection Bay, north of a line between Cape Resurrection and Aialik Cape, is closed year round, and lingcod fishing in all other waters does not open until July 1.

The technician interviews returning anglers and samples halibut, rockfish, and sharks for length, weight, sex, and age. You can help by providing information when interviewed and by returning fish carcasses to the harbor for sampling. The information collected by this project is used to monitor the health of the fishery, advise halibut management agencies, and help the Board of Fisheries formulate regulations that protect fish stock and provide maximum fishing opportunity. Contact Dan Bosch in Anchorage at (907) 267-2153 for more information.\nHerring are caught in late April/early May by anglers fishing a herring rig (15 or fewer small, unbaited hooks on a single line) in the Seward Small Boat Harbor. Herring are used as both a food fish and a baitfish. There is no bag limit.\nShellfish\nNorth Gulf Coast is closed to crabbing year-round, due to low population levels.

Smaller boats occasionally have good success in the deeper waters of Resurrection Bay, with better fishing east of Cape Resurrection.\nSalmon\nEarly June sees the hatchery king salmon run into Resurrection Bay \"hit the beach\" near the Seward Lagoon outfall culverts, and near the Lowell Creek waterfall. This run should peak in mid- to late June. Anglers will have the highest harvest rates fishing 1-2 hours before and after high tide. Kings can be taken using a variety of lures and bait as well as snagging. Anglers also have success trolling for kings near these locations, using herring as bait, and setting a flasher above the lure.\nKing salmon can also be found throughout the bay, with the best fishing in the south, or middle section of the bay. You will benefit be using a fish finder to help adjust your trolling depth.\nIn Resurrection Bay waters from May 1 – August 31, the daily bag limit in saltwater for king salmon is two, with no size restrictions. In Resurrection Bay waters the rest of the year, and in the rest of North Gulf Coast management area waters all year, the daily bag limit is 1 king salmon. Though a king salmon stamp is required, kings caught in Resurrection Bay do not need to be recorded on the back of the license or harvest record card.\nAnglers trolling in Resurrection Bay also have a chance of picking up a chum salmon or sockeye (red) salmon. Anglers fishing the salt waters near the mouth of Resurrection River sometimes have fair success snagging red salmon as the fish attempt to return to the Bear Creek weir. Mid-June anglers trolling for kings in outer Resurrection Bay waters often report chum salmon in their catch. By the end of June, trollers outside of Resurrection Bay sometimes pick up a few silvers in the Pony Cove/ Cheval Narrows area.\nPink salmon return to many of the bay's freshwater streams by late June. They provide excellent action on light tackle, and aren't bad eating if you catch them fresh and silvery, and cook them right away.\nThe daily bag limits in saltwater for salmon (other than kings) is six.\nWith the exception of a portion of the Resurrection River (consult the regulation booklet before fishing this river), all Resurrection Bay freshwater drainages are closed year-round to salmon fishing.\nOther Saltwater Fishing Opportunities\nRockfish fishing is typically good all summer. By slowly retrieving a black (pelagic) rockfish, the entire school can often be lured to the surface for excellent shallow-water action. Rockfish can usually be released without injury if caught in less than 60 feet of water.\nAnglers should review the rockfish regulations before they head out. Additional protection is needed for non-pelagic species because of their extreme longevity and low productivity. Anglers targeting rockfish are encouraged to fish for black or dusky rockfish in waters less than 10 fathoms (60 feet) to minimize mortality of released fish.\nThe daily bag limit in waters near Seward (Gore Point to Cape Puget) is four rockfish, no more than one of which may be a non-pelagic species. Consult the chart on page 10 of the Southcentral Sport Fishing Regulation Summary to identify non-pelagic species. The bag limit in Prince William Sound (east of Cape Puget) is five rockfish, no more than two of which may be non-pelagic species, and you must retain the first two non-pelagic species you catch.\nAnglers are cautioned that bag limits apply to the waters you are fishing. Therefore, if you retain a bag limit of two non-pelagic rockfish while fishing east of Cape Puget and then fish in waters west of Cape Puget, you are in violation of the bag limit for the waters you are fishing. Halibut anglers are strongly encouraged to fish with a single large hook (size 16 or larger) and avoid rocky areas to minimize their unintentional rockfish catch.\nRemember, it is illegal to fish for, or harvest, lingcod until July 1, and Resurrection Bay is closed to lingcod fishing year-round north of a line from Aialik Cape to Cape Resurrection. Targeting lingcod, even for catch and release, is not allowed. All lingcod incidentally caught must be landed by hand or with a landing net and released immediately.\nThe daily bag limit for sharks is one fish of any species, and the annual limit is two sharks of any species. This includes spiny dogfish as well as salmon and sleeper sharks. Sleeper sharks are generally considered inedible and should be released. All harvested sharks must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record. Please do not cut off the head or tail until after the fish is landed to ensure that ADF&G port samplers have an opportunity to obtain measurements.\nSharks have a high urea content, and are inedible unless handled properly. Bleed your shark immediately upon capture by cutting the underside of the tail, and let the bleeding continue until the heart stops. Gutting the fish with a single cut from the anus to the gills can enhance the quality of the meat.\nThe Division of Sport Fish collects data from the recreational bottomfish fishery in the Seward boat harbor. A fishery technician interviews returning anglers and samples halibut, rockfish, lingcod, and sharks for length, weight, sex, and age statistics. You can help by providing information when interviewed and by returning fish carcasses to the harbor for sampling by the technicians. Information collected by this project is used to monitor the health of the fishery, advise halibut management agencies, and help the Board of Fisheries formulate regulations that protect fish stock and provide maximum fishing opportunity. Contact Dan Bosch in Anchorage at (907) 267-2153 for additional information.\nShellfish\nNorth Gulf Coast is closed to all crabbing due to low population levels. One section of the North Gulf Coast, from Aialik Cape west to Gore Point, is open to shrimping, by Alaska residents only, with a permit. This pot fishery is open from April 15 - September 15.\nFresh Water Fishing Opportunities\nThe Resurrection River drainage downstream of the Seward Highway and Nash Road does not open to salmon fishing until August 1. If you are fishing this area for salmon, you must be on the ocean side of the ADF&G markers located at the mouth of the Resurrection River.\nMost Resurrection Bay freshwater lakes and streams are open year round to Dolly Varden, rainbow trout, lake trout, and Arctic grayling sport fishing. There are several lakes and streams in the Seward area accessible by road or trail that support resident fish populations. A free handout outlining sport fishing opportunities in the Seward area is available at your local ADF&G office, or on the Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Brochures page."

    "full_text": "July Season\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing generally remains good in July, with charter boats consistently enjoying higher success rates. The long-term average size for halibut in July is 23-27 pounds, with about 10% of the harvest above 50 pounds.\nSalmon\nThe tail end of the run of the early hatchery king salmon usually provides a short spurt of action for beach and boat anglers in the first week of July.\nSilver salmon return to Resurrection Bay in large numbers. By early July, silver salmon are usually caught in outer Resurrection Bay waters: Pony Cove, Sunny Cove, and Eldorado Narrows. Try trolling in fairly shallow waters with hoochies, squid, or herring near areas of bird and baitfish activity. Change depths often to get into fish. Some anglers also have good success mooching. Don't look for the beach silver salmon fisheries to “heat up” until mid- to late August. When the silvers finally hit the beach, fishing is usually excellent.\nIn even-numbered years (2006, 2008, 2010), pink salmon should begin showing up in salt waters near Spring and Tonsina creeks and in Thumb Cove by mid-July.\nThe daily bag limit for kings is two and the daily bag limit for salmon other than kings is six.\nWith the exception of the Resurrection River, all freshwater drainages flowing into Resurrection Bay are closed year-round to all salmon fishing.\nOther Saltwater Fishing Opportunities\nTossing small spinners off the beach near Lowell Point may produce a Dolly Varden or two.\nRockfish fishing is typically good all summer. Anglers should review the rockfish regulations before they head out. Additional protection is needed for non-pelagic species because of their extreme longevity and low productivity.

Halibut anglers are strongly encouraged to fish with a single large hook (size 16 or larger) and avoid rocky areas to minimize their unintentional rockfish catch. Remember that rockfish are relatively difficult to clean and do not yield a high percentage of usable meat. Because rockfish are long-lived (some in excess of 100 years) and grow slowly, they cannot support a “meat fishery.”\nSome rockfish species can support shallow-water catch-and-release fishing. Schools of black or dusky rockfish can be lured to shallow water using lures without hooks, then taken on light spinning tackle or fly fishing gear. Rockfish can usually be released without injury if caught in less than 60 feet of water.\nLingcod fishing opens July 1, but special restrictions remain in effect. The limit between Gore Point and Cape Puget is one fish daily (one in possession), and the limit in Prince William Sound waters east of Cape Puget is two fish daily (four in possession). All lingcod must be at least 35 inches in length, and must be landed by hand or with a landing net (no gaffs). Resurrection Bay remains closed to lingcod fishing year-round north of a line from Aialik Cape to Cape Resurrection. Targeting lingcod in Resurrection Bay, even for catch and release, is not allowed. All lingcod caught incidentally in Resurrection Bay must be landed only by hand or with a landing net and released immediately.\nBag limits apply to the waters you are fishing. Therefore, if you retain a bag limit of two non-pelagic rockfish while fishing east of Cape Puget and then fish in waters west of Cape Puget, you are in violation of the bag limit for the waters you are fishing. Likewise, if you take a lingcod from waters outside of Resurrection Bay and then stop to fish for other species in Resurrection Bay, you are in violation because Resurrection Bay is closed to lingcod fishing. All harvested fish become part of the bag limit of the angler who originally hooked it.\nThe daily bag limit for sharks is one fish of any species, and the annual limit is two sharks of any species. This includes spiny dogfish as well as salmon and sleeper sharks. Sleeper sharks are generally considered inedible and should be released. All harvested sharks must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record.\nSharks have a high urea content, and are inedible unless handled properly.

    "date": "Aug",
    "full_text": "August Season\nHalibut\nWhen weather cooperates, halibut fishing can be good in Resurrection Bay and good to excellent in the North Gulf Coast. Catch rates can sometimes drop in mid-August as larger fish disperse from summer feeding areas. The average weight of harvested halibut should be around 25 pounds.\nSalmon\nAugust is the month for silver salmon in Resurrection Bay. Silvers return to Resurrection Bay in large numbers, and the run is enhanced by hundreds of thousands of smolt stocked annually by the Division of Sport Fish and by private, non-profit hatcheries. The stocking should produce an annual return of 20,000 enhanced silvers.\nExpect early catches from Pony Cove, Eldorado Narrows, and on the western side of Fox Island. Silvers move up the bay nearer to Caines Head by mid-August, and usually hit the Seward beaches around the third or fourth week of August. Trolling near both shorelines in Resurrection during August produces some very good silver catches. If you have never fished from your boat in this bay, follow the other boats. Shore anglers can try the Lowell Creek waterfall, the Seward Lagoon outfall culverts, and the salt waters in front of Fourth of July Creek. While many shore anglers are snagging (which is legal in Resurrection Bay), many also use lures and have good luck. The perennial Alaskan favorite for silvers is the PixeeTM spoon, but almost any shiny lure or flashy fly will work. This is also a good time to troll off the Seward beaches to target these stocked fish.\nThe Seward Silver Salmon Derby runs from about the second Saturday in August through the third Sunday in August. Expect crowded conditions for this popular derby. A little extra courtesy and patience in busy times helps everyone have a better time fishing.\nDon’t forget that, with the exception of a portion of the Resurrection River, all fresh waters draining into Resurrection Bay are closed year-round to salmon fishing.\nA few pink salmon return to many Resurrection Bay area streams, and present a fun saltwater opportunity. Try the mouths of Spring and Tonsina creeks.\nDaily bag and possession limits for salmon (other than kings) are 6 per day. Inside Resurrection Bay, all six of your daily bag limit may be silver (coho) salmon. Outside of Resurrection Bay, you may still keep 6 salmon, but only 3 of them may be silver salmon. Daily bag and possession limits for kings are two, any size.\nOther Saltwater Fishing Opportunities\nTossing small spinners or fishing a piece of cut herring off the beach near Lowell Point may produce a Dolly Varden or two in early August.\nRockfish fishing should continue to be good. Anglers should review the rockfish regulations before they head out. Additional protection is needed for non-pelagic species because of their extreme longevity and low productivity. The daily bag limit in waters near Seward (Gore Point to Cape Puget) is four rockfish, no more than one of which may be a non-pelagic species.

The limit between Gore Point and Cape Puget is one fish daily (one in possession), and the limit in Prince William Sound waters east of Cape Puget is two fish daily (four in possession). All lingcod must be at least 35 inches in length with the head attached, or 28 inches from the tip of the tail to front of the dorsal fin with the head removed. A lingcod that is gaffed must be retained. A gaff may not be used to puncture any fish intended or required to be released. Resurrection Bay remains closed to lingcod fishing year-round north of a line from Aialik Cape to Cape Resurrection. Targeting lingcod in Resurrection Bay, even for catch and release, is not allowed. All lingcod caught incidentally in Resurrection Bay must be landed only by hand or with a landing net and released immediately.\nBag limits apply to the waters you are fishing.

    "title": "Sep",
    "date": "Sep",
    "full_text": "September Season\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing typically slows down in September. Many of the adult fish have started their offshore migration, and many anglers turn their attentions to silver salmon during this time, but those who persist may have success. Anglers can expect to catch mostly small halibut inside Resurrection Bay, with better fishing in outside waters. Fall storms and rough marine conditions are also more frequent this time of the year.\nSalmon\nSilver salmon are still plentiful in Resurrection Bay throughout September. Shore-based anglers will have success fishing the incoming tides near the Lowell Creek waterfall and the Seward Lagoon outfall culverts. Another good place to try is the breakwater near the Seward Small Boat Harbor. The daily bag limits in saltwater for salmon (other than kings) is six.\nThere may also be a few silver salmon left in the fresh waters of the Resurrection River (see freshwater opportunities, below, for more details).\nOther Salt Water Fishing Opportunities\nLingcod fishing in Resurrection Bay north of a line between Cape Resurrection and Aialik Cape is closed year round. All lingcod incidentally caught must be landed by hand or with a landing net and released immediately. Closures are necessary in order to protect spawning fish and populations with low abundance.\nLingcod fishing outside Resurrection Bay can be good during September, but again, is weather-dependent.\nAnglers leaving from Seward should review the rockfish regulations before heading out. The latitude of Cape Puget is the dividing line between two areas that have different rockfish regulations: 1) Prince William Sound, and 2) The North Gulf Coast (which includes Resurrection Bay).\nIn Prince William Sound, anglers must keep the first two non-pelagic rockfish they catch. Daily limits for rockfish, including non-pelagic rockfish are also different in the two areas.\nNon-pelagic rockfish – such as “red snapper” – need this additional protection because they rarely survive the change in pressure as they are brought to the surface. Rockfish are extremely long-lived fish, and are slow to reach sexual maturity. Overharvest would quickly reduce the number of mature fish available to spawn. Anglers targeting rockfish are encouraged to fish for black or dusky rockfish in waters less than 10 fathoms (60 feet) so that fish that are released have a fair chance at survival. Also, halibut anglers are strongly encouraged to fish with a single large hook (size 16 or larger) and avoid rocky areas to minimize their unintentional rockfish catch. There’s a handy rockfish ID chart posted on the web, and also printed in our regulation booklet.\nSharks are occasionally taken in Resurrection Bay fisheries. The daily bag limit for sharks is one fish of any species, and the annual limit is two sharks of any species. This includes spiny dogfish as well as salmon and sleeper sharks. Sleeper sharks are generally considered inedible and should be released. All harvested sharks must be recorded immediately upon capture on the back of your license or on your Harvest Record Card.\nSharks have a high urea content, and are inedible unless handled properly. Bleed your shark immediately upon capture by cutting the underside of the tail, and let the bleeding continue until the heart stops. Gutting the fish with a single cut from the anus to the gills can enhance the quality of the meat. Please don’t discard the head or tail until after the fish is brought back to port, so that the ADF&G port sampler has an opportunity to obtain measurements.\nBag limits “carry over” between areas, and daily limits apply per day, NOT PER AREA. For example, if you keep 2 red snapper (non-pelagic rockfish) east of Cape Puget, then travel west of Cape Puget and stop to fish, you are over your daily limit, because west of Cape Puget the daily limit for non-pelagic rockfish is 1. You may pass through an area on your way back to port, but check the limits if you’re thinking about stopping to fish.\nThrough mid-September, ADF&G has a port sampler stationed in the Seward Small Boat Harbor. The technician interviews returning anglers and samples halibut, rockfish, and sharks for length, weight, sex, and age. You can help by providing information when interviewed and by returning fish carcasses to the harbor for sampling. The information collected by this project is used to monitor the health of the fishery, advise halibut management agencies, and help the Board of Fisheries formulate regulations that protect fish stocks and provide maximum fishing opportunity.

(Neither the ADF&G Permanent ID license nor the ADF&G Disabled Veteran's license expire.)\nThe sport fishing regulation booklets are good through April 15. Look for new booklets in early April.\nRainbow Trout - Flowing Waters\nRainbow trout fishing on the flowing waters in the ice-covered months should be good to excellent. Look for trout in the deeper pools and side-sloughs, and be sure your hole is marked well, and off the usual snowmachine trails. Watch out for areas of overflow. Also keep in mind that most of the flowing waters are single-hook and no bait. Remember, Montana Creek, Willow Creek and the North Fork of the Kashwitna River are catch-and-release only for rainbow trout and grayling, except that in Willow Creek upstream of the Parks Highway bridge, 1 rainbow trout less than 16 inches long is allowed daily.\nLakes\nOnce lake ice is safe enough for travel (6 inches of clear ice for foot traffic, 12 inches for vehicle), ice fishing is usually great on the area's many stocked lakes. Beware! Ice thickness can vary widely from system to system, and travel on the ice is at your own risk. ADF&G does not monitor ice thickness. For ice and snow pack conditions on state lands, call Alaska State Parks in Palmer at (907) 745-3975.\nA few lakes are stocked for winter ice fishing, usually sometime in late October or early November. Anglers can check the status of the lake by using the stocking database on our website. The web pages also have links to maps of the area's stocked lakes. You can also find a listing of stocked lakes in the regulation booklet. Remember the limit for rainbow trout in stocked lakes is 5 fish per day (of which only one may be over 20 inches).\nJig lures or lower bait (if allowed) near drop off areas and areas of underwater contours for rainbow trout and catchable salmon. The more popular baits include fresh (not frozen) cocktail shrimp, canned clams, single salmon eggs, or preserved salmon egg clusters. For lake trout/char, fish the bottom of the deepest hole you can find. Some lakes have more restrictive tackle and bag limits than others, please check the regulations before you head out to fish.\nOnly 2 trout may be harvested in lakes having native trout populations. A stocked lake handout is available from Department of Fish and Game offices in Palmer and Anchorage to assist you in finding good angling opportunities.\nNorthern Pike\nPike fishing success is great during ice fishing season. For road-accessible pike fishing, try South Rolly, Tanaina, Long and Memory lakes. For fly-in or snowmachine-in pike fishing, it's hard to beat Alexander and Trapper lakes. Pike are also to be found in Flathorn, Sucker and Eightmile lakes.\nPike respond well to decoys, shiny silver jigs, and lures through the ice. Check the regs before you use bait. Where bait is allowed, chunks of herring work well, and whole sardines or hooligan.\nThere are many lakes where using 5 lines through the ice is legal for pike. Check the reg book, or visit the Pike Page on our website. Also when pike fishing through the ice anglers may use two hooks on a single line, provided that both hooks are attached to one single piece of bait.\nA handout describing the Pike Fisheries in the Mat-Su area is available at department offices in Anchorage and Palmer.\nAgain, ice thickness is not monitored by ADF&G. The Susitna Flats Game Refuge is closed to motorized vehicles until there is 12 inches of snow atop 12 inches of frozen ground. Call Alaska State Parks in Palmer at (907) 745-3975 for more info on snow cover and ice thickness on state lands. For other lands, try to find a local source of info, such as lodges and private property owners."

Neither the ADF&G Permanent ID license nor the ADF&G Disabled Veteran's license expire.\nThe sport fishing regulation booklets are good through April 15. Look for new booklets around early April.\nIce conditions are usually good through mid-April, but make test holes before going out on the ice. Ice conditions vary greatly from one system to the next. Typically, lake ice melts near the shoreline first. ADF&G does not keep track of ice thickness, and travel on the ice is at your own risk. For ice and snow pack conditions on state lands, call Alaska State Parks in Palmer at (907) 745-3975.\nOnce ice recedes, the open leads are usually full of hungry fish, catching tidbits melting from the ice. Try casting small spinners or dark-colored flies right to the edge of the ice.\nRainbow Trout - Flowing Waters\nMany flowing waters are closed to ALL fishing for rainbow trout beginning April 15, to protect spawning fish. Some waters allow only catch-and-release of rainbow trout starting April 15. A careful review of the regulation booklet is necessary before heading out to fish.\nIn waters that are open to rainbow trout fishing, success should be fair to good. Also keep in mind that most of the flowing waters are single-hook, no bait through the end of May. Remember, Montana Creek, Willow Creek and the North Fork of the Kashwitna River are catch-and-release only for rainbow trout and grayling, except that in Willow Creek upstream of the Parks Highway bridge, 1 rainbow trout less than 16 inches long is allowed daily.\nIn order to help conserve this resource, it is suggested that you use barbless hooks, or pinch down the barbs on regular hooks.\nLakes\nWarmer weather and longer daylight hours usually spell success on area lakes until break-up, especially on those lakes that were stocked in late October and early November. Remember to chop or drill a test hole to be sure lake ice is still thick enough for travel.\nThe web pages have links to maps of the area's stocked lakes.

    "full_text": "May Season\nWater Conditions\nThe Susitna River is usually ice-free by mid-May, which prompts a few early season anglers begin launching from Deshka Landing and Susitna Landing.\nMany of the low-lying lakes become free of ice by mid-May. If the winter has been a particularly cold one, don't expect the higher-elevation lakes, or the more northerly lakes, to break up until after Memorial Day. Once the lakes are free of ice, they will go through the process of spring “turnover,” during which water temperatures become uniform and spring winds mix nutrients and oxygen throughout the water column. Major food items for fish, specifically insect larva, begin to emerge from the lake bottom and fish become very active.\nSalmon\nKing salmon start to make their appearance in a few Northern Cook Inlet streams by mid- to late May. The waters downstream of Burma Landing on the Little Susitna River, the mouth of Alexander Creek, and the mouth of the Deshka River are the first places anglers report catches, usually by the end of the second week in May.\nAlthough it is still early for large numbers of king salmon to be present in Northern Cook Inlet waters, increasing numbers will be entering freshwater rivers on each high tide. A patient angler in mid-May who is willing to put in the time may be rewarded with an early season king salmon. By the end of May, kings usually have traveled as far as Lake Creek off the Yentna River, and few may even show up at the Willow Creek confluence.\nBy mid-May, a few kings arrive in West Cook Inlet streams, but fishing doesn't heat up until June.\nEach stream has its own regulations, so careful attention to the regulation booklet is required.\nRainbow Trout - Flowing Waters\nDuring the month of May, rainbow trout that have wintered over in the lakes, or the deeper pools start to move out in search of spawning grounds, and then food. Spawning trout are very vulnerable to harvest. For this reason, there are many waters closed entirely to sport fishing, and many waters closed to the retention of rainbows. Please check the regulation booklet carefully.\nStocked Lakes\nArea lakes present a great fishing opportunity. Many species of native and hatchery fish are present, and are often hungry in May. The stocking truck also makes its rounds by late May. Mat-Su valley lakes are stocked with either rainbow trout, landlocked salmon, Arctic grayling, lake trout, or Arctic char, or some combination of these fish. Be sure to check the regulation booklet closely before fishing, since a few lakes have tackle and bait restrictions and open and closed seasons.\nNorthern Pike\nPike fishing is usually excellent throughout the month of May, as spawning fish congregate in shallow areas. For road-accessible pike fishing try the Nancy Lake Canoe System lakes. For fly-in pike fishing try Alexander, Eightmile and Sucker lakes.\nHooligan/Smelt\nThe Susitna River hooligan run begins in early May. By mid-May, excellent catches are usually reported downstream of the Yentna-Susitna confluence. In late May, try the Susitna River just downstream of the mouth of Willow Creek."

    "full_text": "June Season\nSalmon\nJune is the “king salmon month” in the Northern Cook Inlet area.\nBy early June, king salmon begin to move into the clear water streams of the Susitna River drainage. This early, highest catch rates are usually from Alexander Creek, Deshka River and the Little Susitna River. By the second week of June, kings may also be as far as the Yentna and the Talachulitna. By the third week of June, a few kings are caught at the mouth of Willow Creek. As June wears on, king fishing improves in the Parks Highway streams. Willow, Little Willow, Sheep, Caswell, Birch, Goose, Grey's, Kashwitna, and Montana Creeks downstream of their Parks Highway bridges, and the lower quarter mile of Rabideux, Sunshine, and Trapper creeks are popular places to try.\nWillow Creek and the other Parks Highway roadside streams are open to king fishing from Jan. 1 through the third Monday in June, and then the following two weekends. When fishing is open, it is allowed 24-hours-per-day. A weekend is Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. Check the regulations carefully.\nThe Little Susitna River continues to produce fair to good catches of king salmon through June, with most of the fishing occurring from the Little Susitna Public Use Facility upstream to the Parks Highway. By late June, fishing is good near the Parks Highway bridge.\nPeak fishing at the mouth of the Deshka River is usually between June 8 and 15. After that, fish are still available if you are willing to travel upstream. The Deshka River is open to the retention of king salmon for the first 19 miles, which is indicated by a marker at Chijuk Creek. A word of caution:there is a weir at river mile 7. Please slow down when crossing the weir. If you are uncomfortable running your boat over the weir a fishery technician will be available to guide you. Weir counts are available on our web pages.\nBy mid-June, the mouth of Alexander Creek is winding down. A few kings may still be passing through the lower river. Fishing is allowed in the first seven miles as indicated by a marker at Trail Creek.\nIn mid-June, catch rates should be good at Lake Creek (Yentna), but expect to share the holes with lots of anglers. Try fishing some of the smaller tributaries and sloughs off the Yentna and Skwentna rivers: Moose Creek, Indian Creek, Fish Lake Creek, Hewitt Creek, Eight-Mile Creek and Canyon Creek. The Talachulitna River may also provide fair fishing by mid-June. Remember: Lake Creek is a fast water system with lots of sweepers. Only about the first three miles of this system are boatable, so exercise extreme caution when boating upstream of the mouth.\nBy mid-June, kings are caught at Clear Creek off the Talkeetna River, although this run usually doesn't peak until the last week in June.\nAs for the West Cook Inlet streams, the Theodore River is open to catch-and-release king fishing and should provide plenty of action by mid-June, once water levels settle from high country melt-off. The Chuit River is also a popular destination. Remember: the king salmon season closes for the West Cook Inlet streams on June 30.\nThe general area king salmon fishing regulations, which establish a five fish seasonal limit and prohibit the use of bait remain in effect. Anglers must record all king salmon harvests on the back of their fishing license or on their harvest record card.\nRainbow Trout - Flowing Waters\nFlowing waters in the Palmer-Wasilla Zone do not open to fishing until June 15. The westside Susitna tributary streams, and the Parks Highway roadside streams from Willow Creek on north are open to fishing, but in waters where retention is allowed, rainbow trout cannot be retained until June 15.\nOnce fishing does open, rainbow trout and grayling are available in the majority of these drainages. These streams are often a fly-fishers paradise, if you can hike above the king salmon anglers and do a good roll cast.\nRemember, only catch-and-release fishing is allowed year-round when fishing for rainbow trout and grayling on Montana and Willow drainages.\nLakes\nIn June, those Mat-Su lakes that are scheduled for stocking have been stocked with beautiful rainbow trout and grayling. Check the web pages for the latest info on where the stocking truck has been. There is a listing of stocked lakes in the regulation booklet. Remember the limit for rainbow trout in stocked lakes is 5 fish per day (of which only one may be over 20 inches).\nOnly 2 trout may be harvested in lakes having native trout populations. A stocked lake handout is available from Department of Fish and Game offices in Palmer and Anchorage to assist you in finding good angling opportunities.\nNorthern Pike\nPike are generally found in shallow water areas. Water temperatures in these shallow areas tend to be fairly warm throughout the day. As the water warms, pike become lethargic and are usually off the bite. For better success, try fishing for pike early mornings or late evenings. Try top water weedless lures and flies in the heavily vegetated bays and sloughs.\nIn June, pike fishing continues to be good although the spawning event is over for the year. For road accessible pike fishing try the Nancy Lake Canoe System lakes, or Memory, Long, and Prator lakes. River anglers can try the slow side sloughs of Willow Creek. For fly-in pike fishing try Hewitt, Whiskey, Figure Eight, Vern and Donkey, Alexander, Eightmile and Sucker lakes.\nA handout describing the Pike Fisheries in the Mat-Su area is available at department offices in Anchorage and Palmer.\nHooligan/Smelt\nBy early June, the Susitna River Hooligan run is well under way. Excellent catches are reported in the Yentna River and in the Susitna River upstream of the Yentna-Susitna confluence. Fishing should continue to be fair through the closure June 15. If you don't have access to a boat try the Susitna River just downstream of the mouth of Willow Creek.\nOnly Alaskan residents are allowed to use a dipnet to fish for hooligan. No permit is required, but you must have your sport fishing license in your possession."

Another good place to try in early July would be the Talachulitna River. The general area king salmon fishing regulations, which establish a five fish seasonal limit and prohibit the use of bait, remain in effect. Anglers must record all king salmon harvests on the back of their fishing license or on their harvest record card.\nIf you can get upstream, the Deshka River also provides good catches through the season closure July 13. There are plenty of good fishing holes between the weir at River Mile 7 and Chijuk Creek. The Deshka River is open to the retention of king salmon for the first 17 miles, which is indicated by a marker at Chijuk Creek. Please slow down when crossing the weir! If you are uncomfortable running your boat over the weir a fishery technician will be available to guide you. Weir counts are available on our web pages.\nThe remainder of the NCI streams close July 13 for king salmon fishing, so if you haven't caught your Northern Cook Inlet king salmon by then, you'll have to fish the Kenai.\nThe Little Susitna River near the Parks Highway bridge also provides early July fishing opportunity for kings, sockeye salmon, and chum salmon. A few sockeye salmon are also available during the Saturday to Sunday weekend-only fishery at Cottonwood Creek.\nA few silver salmon may start showing up by mid-July, but silver fishing is not usually good until at least the third week in July. Early season anglers try Eklutna tailrace and Jim Creek, or at the Deshka or Alexander river mouths. By the third week of July, a few silvers also show up in the weekend-only Cottonwood Creek fishery. Also by the third week, a few silvers start to be caught from the Parks Highway roadside streams (Willow, Little Willow, etc.) Silver fishing heats up the last week of July, and can be good all the way through September.\nTraditionally the peak fishing for Little Susitna River silvers near the Public Use Facility (Burma Landing) is not until the first few days in August\nRainbow Trout - Flowing Waters\nRainbow trout and grayling are available in the majority of Northern Cook Inlet drainages. These streams are often a fly-fishers paradise, if you can hike above the salmon anglers and do a good roll cast.\nRemember, only catch-and-release fishing is allowed year-round when fishing for rainbow trout and grayling on Montana and Willow drainages, and in the North Fork Kashwitna River.\nStocked Lakes\nLake fishing in July is excellent, especially in early morning and late evening hours.

    "full_text": "August Season\nSalmon\nSilver salmon are the fish of the month in the northern Cook Inlet area. By early August, road system anglers can still find lots of silvers in the lower Little Susitna River (near the Public Use Facility), at the Eklutna Power Plant tailrace, and at the mouth of Cottonwood Creek. Boat anglers will find early silvers at the mouths of the Alexander and Deshka rivers, and in Yentna river tributaries such as Lake Creek.\nMid-August sees silvers in good numbers in the upper Little Susitna River, Jim Creek, and the Eklutna tailrace, and in good numbers at the mouths of Willow and Little Willow creeks. The rest of the Parks Highway roadside streams - Sheep, Montana, Rabideux, Birch, Goose, Sunshine, and Caswell - should be excellent fishing by the third week of August, through early September.\nAnglers with boats should be at the mouth of the Deshka River by early August for some excellent action. Try fishing the tributaries of No-name, Trapper and Chijuk creeks as coho tend to congregate in these areas. Good to excellent fishing for coho can be expected in Alexander Creek, and the Yentna River tributaries such as Lake Creek, Indian Creek, and Hewitt Creek. But by the end of the third week of August, anglers in these systems will have to go upstream to find the fish.\nAlso by early to mid-August, there are usually lots of silvers showing up in such West Cook Inlet streams as the Theodore, Chuit and Lewis rivers. By mid-August, the Talachulitna River is also fishable for silvers.\nBy the second week of August, the silvers will have moved up as high as the Talkeetna River and such tributaries as Clear Creek, and by the third week in August fishing gets very good.\nFor the most successful fishing, try using salmon roe on your spoon or spinner. Pixees™, Vibrax™, and the \"yarn fly\" are perennial Alaskan favorites. Early morning usually providing the best catch rates.\nRemember, on the Little Susitna River you are allowed to use bait starting August 6, and catch-and-release fishing for coho salmon is prohibited once you retain a bag limit (2) of coho salmon on the Little Susitna River downstream of a ADF&G regulatory marker located at river mile 32.5. Also, Cottonwood Creek is a weekend-only fishery and fishing is only allowed between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.\nEarly August sees a small run of sockeye salmon at the Eklutna Power Plant tailrace, Jim Creek, and out at Cottonwood Creek. Expect the sockeye salmon run to end by the last week of August.\nOn even-numbered years, hundreds of thousands of pink salmon can be found in Northern Cook Inlet streams through the month of August. Good numbers of chum salmon also return in early to mid-August.\nRainbow Trout - Flowing Waters\nRainbow trout fishing should be great for the Parks Highway streams. This time of year rainbow trout tend to congregate behind spawning king salmon to feed on eggs. For fly fishing, try using those egg patterns that most resemble king salmon eggs and egg-sucking leeches. If you prefer spinning gear try using an orange or number 1 or 2 Vibrax™, or Mepps™ spinners. On all of these roadside streams, when fishing upstream of their Parks Highway bridges only single-hook, unbaited, artificial lures may be used. Remember, Montana Creek, Willow Creek and the North Fork of the Kashwitna River are catch-and-release only for rainbow trout and grayling.\nLakes\nLake fishing in August is excellent, especially in early morning and late evening hours. There is a listing of stocked lakes in the regulation booklet. Remember the limit for rainbow trout in stocked lakes is 5 fish per day (of which only one may be over 20 inches).\nOnly 2 trout may be harvested in lakes having native trout populations.

    "full_text": "September through October Season\nSalmon\nSmall numbers of silver salmon continue to be available in Northern Cook Inlet fresh waters through the end of the third week of September. Best success comes from the Talkeetna River drainage, with most anglers concentrated at Clear Creek.\nWillow Creek, Montana Creek, and the Eklutna Power Plant tailrace also usually see a few late silvers trickling in through mid-September. Jim Creek also has a late run of silvers through October.\nIn early September, fair to good silver fishing can be found in the tributaries and sloughs of the Yentna and Skwentna rivers. Most anglers try at Moose, Indian, Bottle, or Hewitt creeks. Fishing success tails off by the end of September.\nFair to good silver fishing should continue through mid-September in such West Cook Inlet streams as the Theodore, Chuit, and Lewis rivers.\nNOTE: Starting September 1, no bait is allowed in most of the Mat-Su valley flowing waters, and in the West Cook Inlet area flowing waters. This does not include the Eklutna Power Plant tailrace (Knik River drainage). Also starting September 1, many waters go to single-hook, no treble/multiple hooks allowed. A single hook has only 1 point, with or without a barb. Check the regulation booklet for a complete description of the area before you go fishing.\nPixees™, Vibrax™, and the “yarn fly” are perennial Alaskan favorites for silver salmon. Good single-hook fly choices include flesh flies, sparkle shrimp, and egg-sucking leeches, sizes 2 through 6. Popular colors for both flies and lures are pinks, oranges and chartreuse/greens. Early morning usually providing the best catch rates.\r\nRainbow Trout - Flowing Waters\nRainbow trout fishing should be good to excellent until water levels drop and it's just too cold to fish. When water levels go down, look for trout in the deeper pools and side-sloughs, or in lakes. Keep in mind the single-hook, no bait restrictions for much of the flowing waters. Remember, Montana Creek, Willow Creek and the North Fork of the Kashwitna River are catch-and-release only for rainbow trout and grayling, except that in Willow Creek upstream of the Parks Highway bridge, 1 rainbow trout less than 16 inches long is allowed daily.\nLakes\nOnce lake ice is safe enough for travel (6 inches of clear ice for foot traffic, 12 inches for vehicle), ice fishing is usually great on the area's many stocked lakes. Travel on the ice is at your own risk. Ice thickness can vary widely from system to system. ADF&G does not monitor ice thickness. For ice and snow pack conditions on state lands, call Alaska State Parks in Palmer at (907) 745-3975.\nA few lakes are stocked specifically for winter ice fishing, usually sometime in late October or early November. Anglers can check the status of the lake by using the stocking database on our website. The web pages also have links to maps of the area's stocked lakes. You can also find a listing of stocked lakes in the regulation booklet. Remember the limit for rainbow trout in stocked lakes is 5 fish per day (of which only one may be over 20 inches).\nJig lures or bait (if allowed) near drop off areas for rainbow trout and catchable salmon. For lake trout/char, fish the bottom of the deepest hole you can find. Some lakes have more restrictive tackle and bag limits, please check the regulations before you head out to fish.\nOnly 2 trout may be harvested in lakes having native trout populations. A stocked lake handout is available from Department of Fish and Game offices in Palmer and Anchorage to assist you in finding good angling opportunities.\nNorthern Pike\nPike fishing success will improve until water levels drop, then taper off until ice fishing season. For road-accessible pike fishing, try South Rolly, Tanaina, and Memory lakes. For fly-in or snowmachine-in pike fishing, it's hard to beat Alexander and Trapper lakes. Pike are also to be found in Sucker and Eightmile lakes.\nPike respond well to decoys, jigs, and lures through the ice. Check the regs before you use bait.\nThere are certain lakes where using 5 lines through the ice is legal for pike.

Be sure to check the Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary booklet carefully!\nAll other salmon fisheries on the Kenai River are closed this time of year. Depending on weather and river conditions, anglers may also find a few late season coho salmon in the Kasilof or Swanson rivers.\nRainbow and Steelhead Trout and Dolly Varden - Flowing Waters\nFishing for these resident fish can be excellent, if weather and water conditions allow. A clear crisp day, something to knock the ice from your s, and a Glo-Bug or Iliamna Pinkie spell excellent flowing water action for rainbow trout and Dolly Varden.\nSome flowing waters are closed to sport fishing from September 15 through October 31, in order to provide spawning Dolly Varden protection. Dolly Varden fishing is open the entire year on the mainstem Kenai and Kasilof rivers. The Russian River is also open this time of year to fishing for Dolly Varden and rainbow trout.\nLake Fishing\nUsually by late November the ice thickens enough for safe travel (6 inches plus for foot traffic, 12 inches plus for vehicle). Once there is enough ice, fishing for stocked rainbow trout, Arctic char, and stocked landlocked Chinook or coho salmon is excellent. Travel on the ice is at your own risk.

For ice and snowpack conditions on state or federal lands, call Alaska State Parks in Soldotna at (907) 262-5581 or the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge at (907) 262-7021.\nIce conditions on Kenai, Skilak, Tustumena and sometimes Hidden lakes, are potentially hazardous. These large lakes do not freeze evenly, and wind and waves often push the ice around so that one three-foot-thick section of ice might be one step away from a section of ice that is only three inches thick.\nThere are 25 lakes throughout the northern Kenai Peninsula area that are stocked with rainbow trout, Arctic char, and landlocked Chinook or coho salmon. Fishing is usually excellent in these lakes in September. Try using small spinners, flies, or, where legal, fresh shrimp or preserved salmon roe.

Through May 15, only single-hook, unbaited, artificial lures are allowed below the Sterling Highway Bridge. After May 15, bait and multiple hooks are allowed. Crooked Creek, a tributary to the Kasilof River, is closed to fishing for Chinook salmon year-round.  Be sure to check the ADF&G website for any emergency orders that may affect this sport fishery.\nSmall numbers of Chinook salmon begin to enter the Kenai River in early to mid-May, with increasing numbers through the end of May. The Division of Sport Fish operates a Chinook salmon sonar site on the mainstem near river mile 14, which generate daily estimates of Chinook salmon passage. These counts are available on the ADF&G fish counts webpage and generally begin being posted around May 20 each year. Waters of the Kenai River downstream of Skilak Lake are open to Chinook salmon fishing in May. There are some closed areas of the river, special tackle restrictions, length restrictions, annual limits, and specific bag and possession limits for early-run Chinook salmon.

Upriver in Soldotna, shore anglers cast from the boardwalks at the Soldotna Visitor's Center, Soldotna Creek Park, or from the City of Soldotna's Centennial or Swiftwater campgrounds. Another opportunity for spring fishing is surf casting into the saltwaters of Cook Inlet. The City of Kenai parking area on the north shore, off Spruce Drive in Kenai provides beach access to Cook Inlet and the mouth of the Kenai River. Bait and treble/multiple hooks may be used in saltwater year-round. In freshwaters of the Kenai River, bait is prohibited until July 1, and treble/multiple hooks are not allowed until August 1. Be sure to check current emergency orders affecting Kenai River salmon sport fisheries as regulations are often amended.  The Southcentral Sport Fishing Regulations Summary booklet also contains maps of public fishing locations.\nThe Chinook salmon early-run usually peaks in early June. Popular freshwater lures include single-hook Spin-N-Glos™, Pixees™, and Vibrax™. Popular plugs for fishing from boats include Kwikfish™ and Wiggle Warts™. A single hook has only one point (with or without a barb). Whichever lure you choose, be sure it's heavy enough to reach the deeper channels, where Chinook salmon prefer to swim. The average size of a Kenai River early-run Chinook is about 30-45 pounds. Occasionally, Chinook salmon up to 75 pounds are caught. 35lb. monofilament line is the minimum line strength recommended and should be paired with a stout mid to heavy weight rod when targeting Chinook salmon on the Kenai River\nKenai River early-run Chinook salmon are managed under the terms of the \"Kenai River and Kasilof River Early-Run King Salmon Management Plan\" (5 AAC 57.160). The optimal escapement goal range is 3,900 – 6,600 large Chinook salmon (> 34 inches in length) as estimated at the RM 14 sonar. Other assessment tools include angler creel surveys and in-river test gillnetting.\nShore anglers wishing to target early-run Chinook salmon on the Kasilof River will head to the Alaska State Parks Crooked Creek State Recreation Site, off North Cohoe Loop Road. Anglers may also fish the Kasilof River from drift boats launching at the Sterling Highway Bridge with boat retrieval occurring in the lower stretches of the river that are tidally influenced. Many guide services are available for both the Kasilof and Kenai rivers. Anglers should check the ADF&G webpage for emergency orders that may affect both the Kasilof and Kenai rivers chinook salmon sport fishery. \nEarly-run Kasilof River Chinook salmon fishery peaks in early June. Beginning May 16, bait and treble/multiple hooks may be used in the Kasilof River. Before May 16, only unbaited, single hooks are allowed. Popular lures include Spin-N-Glos™, Pixees™, Vibrax™, Okie Drifters™, and yarn flies. Lures are often sweetened with a chunk of preserved salmon roe.  Average size of Kasilof River early-run Chinook salmon is about 15-25 pounds. 20-lb. monofilament line is the minimum line strength recommended when targeting Chinook salmon on the Kasilof River.\nRainbow/Steelhead Trout and Dolly Varden\nSpawning season for rainbow/steelhead trout occurs in the springtime. During this time fish become vulnerable and require conservative fishing regulations so that they are protected from over exploitation. Eggs are also extremely fragile in the first few weeks, and spawning beds must be protected as much as possible. Spring is an excellent time to observe rainbow trout spawning on the Russian River and to reflect on the conservation of this natural resource. Please note the upper Kenai River, parts of the middle Kenai River, and all Kenai River tributaries are closed to all fishing May 1 through June 10 to protect spawning rainbow trout.  Please review the Southcentral Sport Fishing Regulations Summary booklet prior to fishing.\nThe Kasilof River presents the only flowing water opportunity for rainbow/steelhead trout fishing in May. The Kasilof River is catch-and-release only for rainbow/steelhead trout, and fish may not be removed from the water prior to release. Through May 15, only single-hook, unbaited, artificial lures are allowed. After May 15, bait and treble/multiple hooks are allowed. The steelhead run is extremely small, so expectations of fast and furious catch-and-release action are unrealistic.\nDolly Varden often begin their spring migration in May and present a good light tackle opportunity throughout both drainages in waters open to sport fishing.\nThe best opportunity to fish for rainbow trout in April and May is at one of the 25 stocked lakes in the area, and carefully selected portions of the lower Kenai River, Kenai and Skilak lakes. The smaller lakes are usually ice-free by early May. If the ice is not completely off the lake, try casting out to the edge of the ice where fish are feeding on freshly immerged aquatic macroinvertebrates.\nPublications describing these lakes are available online and at ADF&G offices in Anchorage, Soldotna, and Homer. Make sure to check out the ADF&G fish stocking and the ADF&G Alaska Lakes Database (ALDAT) webpages for up-to-date lake stocking information."

    "full_text": "June Season\nWater Levels\nWater levels generally go up from their spring lows by mid-June, and once the high, muddy water passes downstream, water clarity and fishing success generally improves.\nTo protect spawning rainbow trout, many of the flowing waters on the Kenai Peninsula are closed to rainbow trout fishing or all fishing activity through June 10. Please check the Southcentral Sport Fishing Regulations Summary booklet carefully before heading out to fish.\nFishing Locations\nThe following is a partial list of some of the more popular sport fishing destinations.\nThe upper Kenai River (above Skilak Lake) reopens to fishing at 12:01 a.m. June 11 (except for the Russian River \"Sanctuary Area\"). Outside the fly-fishing-only areas, legal tackle is one unbaited, single hook, artificial lure or fly with the gap between point and shank being 3/8-inch or less. In the fly-fishing-only areas, the tackle must be one unweighted, single-hook, unbaited fly with gap between the point and shank of 3/8 inch or less.  The fly must weigh less than ¼ oz. Sockeye salmon and resident species fishing in the upper Kenai and Russian rivers will be progressively getting better over the month of June as early-run Russian River sockeye salmon return to their spawning grounds.\nThe Russian River Sanctuary Area is not scheduled to open until July 15 but watch the ADF&G website for emergency orders affecting the opening date as it is possible it will open earlier.\nThe lower Kenai River (below Skilak Lake) opens for trout fishing 12:01 a.m. June 11. In June, the lower Kenai River is open for Chinook, sockeye, and pink salmon, as well as, Arctic char/Dolly Varden fishing. Legal fishing tackle is restricted to one unbaited, single-hook, artificial lure, any size hook. In flowing waters, beads fished ahead of flies, lures, or bare hooks must be fixed within two inches of the hook or be free sliding on the entire length of the line or leader. There are many public access points on the Kenai River. The Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary booklet has maps depicting these areas and is a good resource for anglers. \nThere are several confluence areas within the lower Kenai River that have special tackle, Chinook salmon fishing, and boating restrictions. Double checking fishing regulations in the Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary booklet and emergency orders is a good idea before heading out on the water.\nIn June, the Kasilof River is open to fishing for Chinook salmon, sockeye salmon, rainbow/steelhead trout, and Dolly Varden. However, rainbow/steelhead trout may not be retained, may not be removed from the water, and must be released immediately if caught. Bait and treble/multiple hooks are allowed in June but can change if there are emergency orders issued. Fishing in Crooked Creek, a tributary of the Kasilof River, is closed to Chinook salmon fishing all year and will not open until August 1 for resident species and coho salmon fishing.\nChinook Salmon - Kenai River\nChinook salmon fishing continues to improve, with the early-run peaking around the second or third week of June. Once the sonar is installed, estimates of large fish passage are posted on the ADF&G fish count webpage. If you are fishing for Chinook salmon from a boat, try single-hook Kwikfish™, Mag/Wiggle Warts™, or Spin-N-Glos™. If you are fishing from shore, try Spin-N-Glos™, Pixees™, Tee-Spoons™, or L'il Corkies™. Chinook salmon tend to run in the deeper channels, down the middle of the river. Be sure you have enough weight on your line so that your lure crosses their path. Always check regulations and emergency orders before heading out to fish. There are some closed areas of the river, special tackle restrictions, length restrictions, annual limits, and specific bag and possession limits for early-run Chinook salmon. Regulations for the early-run often change by emergency order as well.\nChinook Salmon - Kasilof River\nIn the Kasilof River, early-run Chinook salmon fishing continues to build until the late-June peak. Excellent catches of 15-25 pound fish are often reported. The early-run is comprised of both hatchery- and naturally-produced Chinook salmon with varying regulations for each. Make sure to double check sport fishing regulations and emergency orders before hitting the river. Bait and treble/multiple hooks may now be used throughout the Kasilof River. Crooked Creek remains closed to Chinook salmon fishing all year and opens to fishing for other species on August 1.\nSockeye Salmon\nJune is the month that early-run sockeye salmon begin to return to the Russian River. The Russian River is a tributary to the Kenai River and is located at approximately river mile 74. June 11 is opening day for fishing on the Russian River. Larger numbers of sockeye salmon aren’t usually present until the last week of June.  To access the Russian River anglers often use the Russian River Ferry system or the Chugach National Forest Russian River Campground. Day use parking and camping is available with extensive trails and boardwalks. The Russian River is a beautiful, clear water stream that is wadable. Be bear aware and adhere to U.S. Forest Service forest orders regarding filleting fish, fish disposal, personal gear, and coolers. \nLegal tackle in the Russian River and Sanctuary area is one unweighted, single-hook, artificial fly, with gap between point and shank 3/8 inch or less. The fly must weigh less than ¼ oz. If weights are used, they must be at least 18 inches ahead of the fly. Most anglers use a bucktail streamer fly, such as a Russian River coho fly, with enough weight so that the fly/hook travels close to the river bottom. Oftentimes, best success is early morning or late evening, when the sun is not directly shining on the river. Sockeye also tend to hug the bank, and long casts are not necessary.\nThe small run of early-run Russian River sockeye does not present much of an opportunity to harvest fish in the mainstem Kenai River downstream of Skilak Lake. The biological escapement goal for Russian River early-run sockeye salmon is 22,000-42,000 sockeye salmon.\nWhen the Russian River weir is installed, daily counts are posted on the ADF&G fish count webpage.\nResidents of Alaska may participate in a \"personal use\" dipnet and gillnet fishery that opens on June 25 at the mouth of the Kasilof Rivers. An Upper Cook Inlet Personal Use permit and a current sport fishing license is required to participate in these fisheries. Special regulations apply. Make sure to check the Southcentral Sport Fishing Regulations Summary booklet for information on fishing times, marker locations, fin clipping, recording harvest, and permit requirements.\nLake Fishing\nWhile flowing water closures to protect spawning rainbow trout are in effect, it can be a great time to concentrate on one of the many Kenai Peninsula's stocked lakes. There are 25 lakes throughout the Northern Kenai Peninsula area that are stocked with rainbow trout, Arctic char and/or landlocked Chinook or coho salmon. Fishing is usually excellent in these lakes in June. Using small spinners, flies, or, where legal, fresh shrimp or preserved salmon roe are recommended tackle. Publications describing these lakes are available online and at ADF&G offices in Anchorage, Soldotna, and Homer. Make sure to check the ADF&G fish stocking and the ADF&G Alaska Lakes Database (ALDAT) webpages for up-to-date lake stocking information.\nAll other Kenai River drainage lakes are open to fishing, with the exceptions of Crescent Lake which is closed to all fishing May 1 - June 10. Bait may be used in all lakes except ¼ mile of all inlet streams that flow into Kenai Lake, Kenai Lake outlet, and Kenai Lake inlet on Skilak Lake. Make sure to check the Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary booklet carefully!"

Bait is allowed, but anglers are still restricted to one single hook. Fishing is usually good to excellent by the third and fourth week of July. No more than two Chinook salmon per year may be harvested from the Kenai River. By regulation, the Chinook salmon sport fishery on the Kenai River ends at 11:59 p.m. July 31, unless changed by emergency order.  Always check regulations and emergency orders before heading out to fish. Regulations for the late-run often change by emergency order as well.\nIf you are fishing for Chinook salmon fishing from a boat, try single-hook Kwikfish™, Mag/Wiggle Warts™ , or Spin-N-Glos™. If you are fishing from shore, try Spin-N-Glos™, Pixees™, Tee-Spoons™, or L'il Corkies™. Chinook salmon tend to run in the deeper channels, down the middle of the river. Be sure you have enough weight on your line so that your lure crosses their path.\nChinook Salmon - Kasilof River\nSuccess in this fishery is mixed, as the water level during this time is high and swift. Fishing seems to pick up towards the end of July. Bait and treble/multiple hooks can be used throughout the Kasilof River but be aware of emergency orders affecting sport fisheries for salmon in the drainage. Crooked Creek remains closed to all fishing through July 31 and is closed to Chinook salmon fishing year-round.  Please respect private property.\nSockeye Salmon\nJuly is usually the month for a bounty of sockeye salmon returning to the Kenai, Russian, and Kasilof rivers. In peak years, more than 40,000 sockeye salmon per day have entered the Kenai River to be caught by both boat and shore anglers. Best times are usually the third and fourth week of July.  Be aware there are seasonal bank closures from July 1 to August 15 where the riverbank is closed to fishing, anglers may fish while standing in the river at least 10 feet of the shoreline.  Reference the Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary booklet for seasonal bank closures, public access points for boat launches, and shore fishing locations. \nThe second run of sockeye salmon on the Kenai River head for drainages throughout the river.  One popular destination is the Russian River mainstem, Russian River Sanctuary, and confluence area by the last week of July and first week of August.  Be bear aware and adhere to U.S. Forest Service forest orders regarding filleting fish, fish disposal, personal gear, and coolers.\nLegal tackle in the Russian River area is an unweighted, single-hook, unbaited, artificial fly, with hook gap no larger than 3/8 inch or less.  If weights are used, they must be fixed at least 18 inches ahead of the fly. Most anglers use a bucktail streamer fly, such as a Russian River Coho Fly, with enough weight at least 18 inches ahead of the fly so that the hook travels close to the bottom of the river. Oftentimes, best success is early morning or late evening, when the sun is not directly shining on the river. Sockeye salmon also tend to hug the bank, and long casts are not necessary.\nDaily weir counts for the Russian River are posted on our website.\nResidents of Alaska may participate in a \"personal use\" dipnet fishery that opens July 10 at the mouth of the Kenai River.  A similar dipnet fishery also occurs at the mouth of the Kasilof River and opens on June 25. A Upper Cook Inlet Personal Use permit and a current sport fishing license are required to participate in these fisheries.  Special regulations apply.  Make sure to check the Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary booklet for information on fishing times, marker locations, fin clipping, recording harvest, and permit requirements.\nPink Salmon - Resurrection Creek \nPink salmon fishing at Resurrection Creek in Hope begins to pick up by the third week of July.  This is a great fishery for children to participate in. Pink salmon are aggressive and will generally take any tackle easily.  Try fishing with a Russian River Coho Fly, Pixees™, small, colorful spoons or spinners.\nRainbow Trout/Dolly Varden - Flowing Waters\nFishing success for rainbow trout and Dolly Varden in Kenai Peninsula drainages is generally good through the month of July, as rainbow trout and Dolly Varden chase spawning salmon upstream and feed on eggs. Good fly patterns to try include egg imitations and salmon flesh flies.\nLake Fishing \nThere are 25 lakes throughout the Northern Kenai Peninsula area that are stocked with rainbow trout, Arctic char, and landlocked Chinook or coho salmon. Fishing is usually excellent in these lakes in July. Try using small spinners, flies, or, where legal, fresh shrimp or preserved salmon roe.

    "full_text": "August Season\nSalmon - Kenai River drainage\nDownstream of Skilak Lake, sockeye salmon fishing usually winds down quickly in the Kenai River by the middle of August. In the upper Kenai River (above Skilak Lake) and in the Russian River, early to middle of- August is usually the best time to catch sockeye salmon.\nCoho salmon start showing up in the lower Kenai River in late July and early August, continuing through the season closure.  Anglers are reminded that the coho salmon bag and possession limits, seasonal closures, and regulations vary depending on the waters you are fishing.  Please review the Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary booklet for regulations specific to coho salmon fishing. In the Russian River area, coho fishing is usually good around the third week of August, and peaks during the second week of September.\nOn even-number years, ample numbers of pink salmon provide an excellent angling opportunity during August and into September. Most people targeting pinks concentrate on the intertidal areas of the Kenai River from Swiftwater Park and Boat Launch area in Soldotna downstream to Cunningham Park in Kenai.  Check the Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary booklet for a map depicting public access locations to fish.\nSalmon - Kasilof River\nSockeye salmon fishing on the Kasilof River is usually subsided by the first week of August. Coho salmon start showing up in August, and peak around the second to third week of August. This is a small run, but fun fishing. Bait and treble/multiple hooks are allowed through September 15.\nRainbow Trout and Dolly Varden - Flowing Waters\nRainbow trout fishing in August on the upper Kenai River can be slow to fair. Sometimes enticing a rainbow trout with a full stomach of salmon eggs to hit your lure is a challenge, but many sport fishing anglers find that's part of the fun. This is the time of year when you may have to try every trick in your tackle box to entice a strike. Dolly Varden fishing in August can also be challenging, depending on where and when you fish.\nLake Fishing\nThere are 25 lakes throughout the northern Kenai Peninsula area that are stocked with rainbow trout, Arctic char, and landlocked Chinook or coho salmon.

The middle of September usually sees great fishing all the way from Cunningham Park up to the Kenai Keys area. Popular shore access points include the boardwalks at the Soldotna Visitor's Center, Soldotna Creek Park, Rotary Park, Morgan's Landing, Izaak Walton State Park, and Bing's Landing. For a map and complete list of public access points, check out the Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary booklet.\nIn September, bait and treble/multiple hooks can be used in Skilak Lake, and in the mainstem Kenai River from the mouth of the Kenai River at Cook Inlet, upstream to the Upper Killey River.\nExcellent coho salmon fishing can be found in the upper Kenai River (above Skilak Lake) from Cooper Landing downstream to the Kenai Canyon from the middle of September to about the second week of October. Bait is not allowed, and anglers may only fish with one unbaited, single hook, artificial fly or lure. The gap between point and shank must be 3/8-inch or less and beads fished ahead of flies, lures, or bare hooks must be fixed within two inches of the hook or be free to slide on the entire length of the line or leader.\nIn the Russian River area, coho salmon fishing is usually best near the end of the second week of September. Weir counts end on the Russian River by early September.\nIn the mainstem Kenai River (including Skilak Lake), once you keep your bag limit of coho salmon, you may not fish in the Kenai River below the Soldotna Bridge on that same day. Bag and possession limits for coho salmon vary depending on the waters you are fishing, by date, and may be in combination with other species.  For a complete summary of coho salmon fishing regulations, checkout the Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary booklet.\nSalmon - Other Fresh Waters\nIn the Kasilof River small numbers of coho salmon continue to be available until the middle of September. Best success comes in the early morning. Beginning September 16, bait and treble/multiple hooks are prohibited. Anglers may only use unbaited, artificial flies or lures.\nThe Swanson River system sees a very small run of coho salmon, usually appearing in the middle of September. Bait and multiple hooks are allowed in the drainage; however, Sucker Creek is closed to all salmon fishing.\nRainbow and Steelhead Trout and Dolly Varden - Flowing Waters\nRainbow trout fishing in September on the upper Kenai River can be slow to excellent, depending on water conditions. Fall rain can cause the river to rise rapidly as well as create turbid conditions. Sometimes enticing a rainbow trout with a full stomach of salmon eggs to hit your unbaited lure is a challenge, but many sport fishing anglers find that's part of the fun. This is the time of year when you may have to try every trick in your tackle box to entice a strike.\nThere is a very small run of steelhead trout in the Kasilof River. Catching a steelhead trout is challenging, but if you are one of the lucky ones, please remember it is illegal to remove the fish from the water and it must be released immediately.\nDolly Varden fishing in September can also be exciting, depending on water conditions. Dolly Varden are in their fall spawning colors at this time and are beautiful fish. Some streams/rivers, including portions of Quartz Creek and Cooper Creek close September 15 to protect spawning Dolly Varden.  Remember to check the Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary booklet closely for fishing regulations specific to individual streams/rivers and drainages.\nLake Fishing\nThere are 25 lakes throughout the northern Kenai Peninsula area that are stocked with rainbow trout, Arctic char, and landlocked Chinook or coho salmon.

A sport fishing license makes a great gift -- especially since it lasts all year long. (Note: Neither the ADF&G Permanent ID license nor the ADF&G Disabled Veteran's license expire.)\nAs of this year, the age requirement for resident licenses has increased to 18, so residents currently 16 and 17 years old no longer need a sport fishing license until they turn 18. Nonresidents 16 years of age and older must purchase a sport fishing license. The price of a sport fishing license has increased to $29 for a resident annual license. Other license fees have changed as well, check out the link below for the current prices:\nhttp://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/home/pdfs/2016_2017_alaska_license_fees.pdf\nThe sport fishing regulations are good through April 15 of the new year. Look for new booklets around March or early April and be sure to check the new regulations!\nSalt water Fishing Opportunities\nHalibut fishing is closed Jan. 1 through Jan. 31, and lingcod fishing is closed Jan. 1 through June 30. Closures are necessary in order to protect spawning fish. Otherwise, when weather permits, hardy anglers may find a few rockfish and smaller halibut.\nSalt water trolling for king salmon has become very popular. King salmon can be found in Kodiak salt waters year round, with fishing success typically increasing in April. In addition to their sport fishing license, anglers sport fishing for king salmon must purchase a current year's king salmon stamp.\nKodiak's Road System (Includes salt waters within 1 mile of Kodiak Island)\nThe Buskin, Saltery and Miam Lake drainages all support relatively small runs of steelhead trout. This catch-and-release only fishery is open year round, with peak of the return typically occurring in late October. In fresh waters of the road system, from November 1 and April 30 only unbaited artificial lures maybe used (with the exception of all road system stocked lakes, Chiniak and Barry Lagoon).\nDolly Varden offers an excellent wintertime fishing opportunity. They can be found over-wintering in fresh waters including lakes or deep pools and are commonly caught on flies and pink colored rubber worms. Buskin Lake has the largest numbers of these excellent sport fish.\nRainbow trout are annually stocked in over 15 lakes on the Kodiak road system and winter fishing can be excellent in open water or through the ice. Some of the more accessible and better producing lakes include Horseshoe, Abercrombie, Lily Pond, Jack, Lee, Aurel and Caroline. The daily bag and possession limit is 10 rainbow trout (only 1 may be 20 inches or longer). There is not an annual limit or closed fishing season on stocked rainbow trout. Rainbow trout fishing is catch and release only in road system lakes that are not currently stocked by ADF&G. Check the current sportfishing regulations booklet for an updated list of stocked lakes.\nWARNING: Lake ice conditions in winter and early spring can be very deceptive. Because of Kodiak's mild climate, the lake ice can be very thin even late into winter. Be sure to check ice conditions carefully. Fishing can be excellent through the ice but also in open waters and right after ice-out.\n\r\n \nKodiak's Remote Area\nFishing for resident rainbows typically remains productive throughout the winter and early spring in areas supporting sizable populations of fish, such as the Malina, Marka and Afognak rivers. Steelhead fishing can be quite productive during late March and April on sections of the Karluk and Ayakulik rivers if conditions allow. Fishing Kodiak Island for rainbow/steelhead trout is open year round, with an annual limit of no more than 2 fish 20\"or longer. All harvested rainbow trout/steelhead 20\" or longer must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record."

    "full_text": "May Season\nSaltwater Fishing Opportunities\nHalibut fishing in the Kodiak area is fair in the early part of May, but typically improves throughout the month. Chiniak Bay, Marmot Bay, and Ugak Bay are the frequently targeted areas. Halibut are usually found in deeper water during the winter months and migrate to shallower water during the spring and summer. Historically the average weight in the sport fishery has been 30-38 pounds in May, with about 10% of the fish over 80 pounds.\nRockfish fishing can be good throughout the month of May. The rockfish bag limit in Kodiak area waters is 5 fish per day and10 in possession, of which only 2 can be non-pelagic species and 1 can be a yellow-eye. In Chiniak and Marmot Bay waters, the rockfish bag limit is 3 per day, 6 in possession and 2 of these (4 in possession) can be non-pelagic and only one of the non-pelagic (2 in possession) can be a yelloweye. Pelagic species (i.e. black and dusky rockfish) are frequently caught and typically weigh between 3 and 4 pounds. Occasionally, the more brightly-colored yellow-eye are caught in deep water and average 9 pounds. There are no size restrictions for harvesting rockfish. Anglers targeting rockfish are encouraged to fish for black or dusky rockfish in waters less than 10 fathoms (60 feet) or use a deep water release mechanism to minimize mortality of released fish.\nLingcod fishing does not open until July 1.\nSharks are occasionally taken in the Kodiak area. The daily bag limit for sharks is one fish of any species (except spiny dogfish), with an annual limit of two sharks. The bag limit for spiny dogfish is 5 per day, 5 in possession with no annual limit. Edible species include spiny dogfish and salmon sharks. All harvested sharks (except spiny dogfish) must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record. Please do not cut off the head or tail until after the fish is landed to ensure that ADF&G port samplers have an opportunity to obtain measurements.\nBeginning in late May, the Division of Sport Fish annually collects data from the recreational marine waters fishery in the Kodiak area. A department technician interviews returning anglers and samples halibut, rockfish, lingcod, and sharks for length, weight, sex, and age statistics, and also records individual catches of salmon. You can help the success of this program by agreeing to be interviewed and waiting to fillet or cut up any harvested fish until they can be sampled at the harbor by department technicians. Information collected by this project is used to monitor the health of the fishery, advise halibut management agencies, and help the Board of Fisheries formulate regulations that protect fish stock and provide maximum fishing opportunity. For more information about the ground fish research program, contact Martin Schuster in the Homer ADF&G Office at (907) 235-1730.\nSalt water trolling for Kodiak king salmon has become very popular. King salmon can be found in salt waters year round, with typically excellent fishing success during May. The best-known fishing spots along the road system are Cape Chiniak and Buoy 4. Kodiak king salmon average 20 pounds or less but fish up to 70 pounds are occasionally taken. In addition to their sport fishing license, anglers sport fishing for king salmon must purchase a current year's king salmon stamp.\nMay on Kodiak's Road System (Includes salt waters within 1 mile of shore)\nSmall numbers of king salmon are beginning to return to Monashka Creek by late May. The best fishing is along the ocean beaches and in the lower reaches of the creek. Daily bag and possession limits for king salmon harvested in fresh waters is 2 fish. For king salmon less than 20 inches , the daily bag and possession limit is 10 fish. An annual limit of 5 for king salmon harvested in freshwater is also in effect. All harvested king salmon over 20 inches taken in fresh water must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record.\nIn late May red salmon begin to return to the Buskin River. Less than 5% of the run typically occurs in May although fish can be found in pockets along the river. The run usually peaks in mid-June, and total weir counts average around 14,000 fish.\nDolly Varden present an excellent, uncrowded opportunity for light tackle action. Dolly Varden usually begin their annual out-migration to saltwater in early May. Try the Buskin River or the ocean beaches at Pillar Creek and Mission Lake. Schools of Dollies can also be found at the mouths of many rivers and creeks feeding on out-migrating pink salmon fry. Anglers usually use small spinners or emergent salmon fry and alevin fly patterns.\nRainbow trout are also available in over 15 stocked lakes on the Kodiak Road System. Some of the more accessible and better producing lakes include Horseshoe, Abercrombie, Lily Pond, Lee, Aurel and Caroline. The daily bag and possession limit is 10 rainbow trout (only 1 may be 20 inches or longer). There is no annual limit or closed fishing season on stocked rainbow trout. Rainbow trout fishing is catch and release only in road system lakes that are not currently stocked by ADF&G. Check the current sportfishing regulations booklet for an updated list of stocked lakes.\nMay in Kodiak's Remote Area\nBy the end of May, king salmon returns to the Karluk and Ayakulik rivers are just beginning. The Ayakulik historicallys averages an escapement of 14,000 fish while the Karluk averages around 9,000 but in recent years these runs have been much smaller. Ayakulik now averages about 9,000 fish while Karluk averages less than 4,000 fish . Returns to both rivers typically peak around June 15. Check for emergency orders pertaining to these two stocks before fishing as restrictions have been placed on Karluk and Ayakulik Chinook in recent years.\nSteelhead are out-migrating to the ocean during May, but fishing for resident rainbow trout should remain productive throughout the month in areas supporting sizable populations of fish, such as the Malina, Marka, Uganik and Afognak Rivers. Fishing Kodiak Island for rainbow/steelhead trout is open year round, with an annual limit of 2 fish 20 inches or longer. All harvested rainbow trout/steelhead 20 inches or longer must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record."

    "full_text": "June Season\nSaltwater Fishing Opportunities\nKodiak halibut fishing in June can be excellent, with good angler success in portions of Chiniak Bay including Buoy 4, Cape Chiniak and waters surrounding Long and Spruce Islands. Halibut harvested from Kodiak waters average 30-35 pounds. Mooching with herring, octopus, salmon heads and artificial jig are preferred methods.\nRockfish fishing can be good throughout the month of June. The rockfish daily bag limit in Kodiak area waters is 5 fish and 10 in possession, of which only 2 can be non-pelagic species and 1 can be a yelloweye. In Chiniak and Marmot Bay waters, the rockfish bag limit is 3 per day, 6 in possession and 2 of these (4 in possession) can be non-pelagic and only one of the non-pelagic (2 in possession) can be a yelloweye. Pelagic species (black and dusky rockfish) are frequently caught and typically weight between 3 and 4 pounds. Occasionally, the more brightly-colored yellow-eye are caught in deep water and average 9 pounds. There are no size restrictions for harvesting rockfish. Anglers targeting rockfish are encouraged to fish for black or dusky rockfish in waters less than 10 fathoms (60 feet) or use a deep-water release mechanism to minimize mortality of released fish.\nLingcod fishing is closed until July 1 to protect male lingcod guarding their nests. Targeting lingcod for catch and release during the closed season is not allowed. All lingcod caught unintentionally must be landed without using a gaff and carefully released.\nSharks are are occasionally taken in the Kodiak area. The daily bag limit for sharks is one fish of any species (except spiny dogfish), an annual limit is two sharks. The bag limit for spiny dogfish is 5 per day with no annual limit. Edible species include spiny dogfish and salmon sharks. All harvested sharks for which the annual limit applies must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record. Please do not cut off the head or tail until after the fish is landed to ensure that ADF&G port samplers have an opportunity to obtain measurements.\nDuring June, the Division of Sport Fish annually collects data from the recreational marine waters fishery in the Kodiak area. A department technician interviews returning anglers and samples halibut, rockfish, lingcod, and sharks for length, weight, sex, and age statistics, and also records individual catches of salmon. You can help the success of this program by agreeing to be interviewed and waiting to fillet or cut up any harvested fish until they can be sampled at the harbor by department technicians. Information collected by this project is used to monitor the health of the fishery, advise halibut management agencies, and help the Board of Fisheries formulate regulations that protect fish stock and provide maximum fishing opportunity. For more information about the ground fish research program, contact Martin Schuster in the Homer ADF&G Office at (907) 235-1730.\nKing salmon can be found in Kodiak salt waters year round, with excellent fishing success during June. The best-known fishing spots along the road system are Cape Chiniak and Buoy 4. Kodiak king salmon average 20 pounds but fish up to 70 pounds are occasionally taken. In addition to their sport fishing license, anglers sport fishing for king salmon must purchase a current year's king salmon stamp.\nJune on Kodiak's Road System (Includes salt waters within 1 mile of shore)\nRed salmon fishing is excellent in the Buskin River during June. The run usually peaks in mid-June and escapement counts average around 14,000 reds. By late June, the Buskin red run is about 85% complete.\nThe Pasagshak River return starts about mid-June, peaks in early July, and is over by the end of July. The estimated average sport harvest of Pasagshak red salmon is 1,500 fish. Red salmon also start to appear in Saltery River in mid to late June. Saltery has the biggest red salmon return on the road system, although a four-wheel drive or ATV is needed to access the fishery. The Saltery run peaks in mid-July with returns averaging around 30,000 reds.\nKing salmon are beginning to return to Monashka Creek, and the Olds and American rivers during June. Early in June the best fishing is along the ocean beaches and in the lower reaches of the creeks, while fish can often be found in deep pools in the creeks later in June. Daily and possession limits for king salmon harvested in fresh waters are 2 fish. For king salmon less than 20\", the daily bag and possession limit is 10 fish. An annual limit of 5 for king salmon harvested in freshwater is also in effect. All harvested king salmon over 20\" taken in fresh water must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record.\nRainbow trout are also available in over 15 stocked lakes on the Kodiak Road System.

See the current regulation booklet for an updated list of stocked lakes.\nDolly Varden present an excellent, uncrowded opportunity for light tackle action. During June Dolly Varden are found in near shore salt waters and are fished from local beaches at Pillar and Myrtle creeks, Mission Lake and Rosyln River. Anglers usually use small spinners such as or emergent salmon fry (alevin) fly patterns.\nSalmon - Remote Area\nBy early June, king salmon returns to the Karluk and Ayakulik rivers are in typically full swing. The Ayakulik historicallys averages an escapement of 14,000 fish while the Karluk averages around 9,000 but in recent years these runs have been much smaller. Ayakulik averages about 9,000 fish while Karluk averages less than 4,000 fish in recent years. Returns to both rivers typically peak around June 15. Check for emergency orders pertaining to these two stocks before fishing as restrictions have been placed on Karluk and Ayakulik Chinook in recent years.\nMost steelhead have out-migrated to the ocean by June, but fishing for resident rainbows should remain productive throughout the month in areas supporting sizable populations of fish, such as the Malina, Marka and Afognak Rivers. Fishing Kodiak Island for rainbow/steelhead trout is open year round, with an annual limit of no more than 2 fish 20\" or longer.

King salmon can be found in salt waters year round, with typically excellent fishing success during August. The best-known fishing spots along the road system are Cape Chiniak and Buoy 4. Kodiak king salmon average 20 pounds or less but fish up to 70 pounds are occasionally taken. In addition to their sport fishing license, anglers sport fishing for king salmon must purchase a current year's king salmon stamp.\nKodiak's Road System (Includes salt waters within 1 mile of Kodiak Island)\nIn early August continue to look for pink salmon in salt waters near streams as well as in fresh waters. Try nearshore fishing off Myrtle and Chiniak creeks and Rosyln River near Cape Chiniak; Sargent and Russian creeks in Women's Bay; the Buskin River; and Pillar and Monashka Creek in Monashka Bay. Peak time for fishing for these excellent sport fish is mid-August. They are dime-bright in salt water, and excellent table fare. By the end of the third week of August, the pink return normally begins to taper off.\nRed salmon fishing at the Saltery River can still be productive during early August, although a four-wheel drive or ATV is needed to access the fishery. The Saltery run normally continues through mid August. Returns to Saltery have annually averaged 30,000 red salmon over the past 10 years.\nChum salmon are also still returning to Kodiak Road System streams through early August. Try the lower sections of the Olds, American and Saltery rivers for these large, feisty salmon.\nBy mid August small numbers of Kodiak's large silver salmon begin to show in road system streams. Angler success is often good, especially on the Buskin, Olds, and American rivers. Excellent silver salmon action can also be found by chartering a boat to troll the near shore salt waters.\nMill Bay and Mission Beach are closed to snagging August 16 through September 15.\nKing salmon returns to the road system are typically over by early August. Fish can still be found in small numbers in the American and Olds rivers, however.\nDolly Varden are available in many of the Road System streams, and present an excellent, uncrowded opportunity for light tackle action. Try the American, Olds, or Buskin rivers.\nRainbow trout are annually stocked in over 15 lakes on the Kodiak road system. Some of the more accessible and better producing lakes include Horseshoe, Abercrombie, Lily Pond, Jack, Lee, Aurel and Caroline. The daily bag and possession limit is 10 rainbow trout (only 1 may be 20 inches or longer). There is not an annual limit or closed fishing season on stocked rainbow trout. Rainbow trout fishing is catch and release only in road system lakes that are not currently stocked by ADF&G. Check the current sportfishing regulations booklet for an updated list of stocked lakes.\nAugust in Kodiak's Remote Area\nKing salmon fishing in fresh waters is now closed for the rest of the year.\nAlthough pink salmon are normally not a targeted species in Kodiak's remote area, excellent fishing for pinks can be found at a number of streams. During even-numbered years, drainages on Kodiak Island's west side often produce exceptionally large adult pink returns.\nStrong late runs of sockeye salmon are normally present on both the Karluk and Ayakulik Rivers during the month of August.\nChum salmon fishing in the Remote Area is at its peak in August, with the largest return occurring on the Sturgeon River.\nSilver returns to Afognak and Shuyak islands are earlier than those at other Kodiak drainages. From mid to late August, silver fishing typically peaks in each of these areas.\nSilvers also return to numerous other drainages including the Ayakulik, Karluk, and Uganik rivers. Late August through early September is the best time to fish the Ayakulik for silvers. The Karluk River return doesn't normally peak until later in September, but small numbers of silvers usually are available by late August. On the Uganik River, the silver salmon return usually peaks in mid-September.\nFishing for resident rainbows should remain productive throughout the month in areas supporting sizable populations of fish, such as the Malina, Marka and Afognak rivers. Fishing Kodiak Island for rainbow/steelhead trout is open year round, with an annual limit of no more than 2 fish 20\" or longer.

The department appreciates assistance provided by all anglers who participated. The information you helped collect is extremely valuable. For more information about the groundfish program, contact Martin Schuster in the Homer ADF&G Office at (907) 235-1730.\nKodiak's Road System (Includes salt waters within 1 mile of Kodiak Island)\nRemember that the road system coho bag limit changes from 2 fish per day to 1 fish per day on September 16th through the end of the year. Exceptions to this are Pillar and Monashka creeks and Mill Bay and Mission Beach that have stocked silver runs and the bag limit is 2 per day year-round.\nSeptember on Kodiak's road system sees some of the best silver salmon fishing in Alaska. Kodiak silvers can weigh as much as 20 pounds or more! Peak road system fishing is usually around mid-September. Best waters include the Buskin, Saltery, Pasagshak, Olds, and American rivers, as well as Roslyn, and Salonie creeks and Kalsin Pond.\nTrolling for silver salmon typically continues with excellent success through September but tapers off toward the end of the month.\nRainbow trout are annually stocked in over 15 lakes on the Kodiak road system.

    "full_text": "October through November Season\nSaltwater Sport Fishing Opportunities\nSalt water sport fishing effort drops off by early October and typically doesn't resume for species other than king salmon until May. Kodiak's inclement fall and winter weather often keeps boats stuck in the harbors. Occasionally, anglers trolling in protected bays will encounter late-run silver salmon in October and November, as well as a few feeder king salmon.\nHalibut can also be caught in deeper waters this time of year but again weather can be a factor in fishing opportunity.\nKodiak's Road System (Includes salt waters within 1 mile of Kodiak Island)\nKodiak's milder climate extends the inshore stream fisheries well into November. There are plenty of rainy, blustery days keeping salt water boats inland, but determined shore anglers will find the silver salmon, Dolly Varden, rainbow and steelhead trout fishing to be excellent.\nSilver salmon fishing success typically slows by late October, but a few bright fish will still be available through the first week of November. Try the Buskin, American, and Olds rivers for these late arriving fish.\nThe Buskin River system supports a relatively small run of steelhead trout. This catch-and-release only fishery is open year round, with peak of the return in late October. In fresh waters along the road system only unbaited artificial lures maybe used between November 1 and April 30 (with the exception of all road system stocked lakes and Barry Lagoons).\nDolly Varden continue to present an excellent fishing opportunity. After spawning during October, they return to lakes or deep pools to over-winter, and can be caught using nymph, scud, alevin and egg pattern flies, and also occasionally small spinners and spoons. The Buskin, American, and Olds rivers; and Salonie Creek have the largest numbers of these excellent sport fish.\nRainbow trout are annually stocked in over 15 lakes on the Kodiak road system and fall fishing can be excellent. Some of the more accessible and better producing lakes include Horseshoe, Abercrombie, Lily Pond, Jack, Lee, Aurel and Caroline. The daily bag and possession limit is 10 rainbow trout (only 1 may be 20 inches or longer). There is not an annual limit or closed fishing season on stocked rainbow trout. Rainbow trout fishing is catch and release only in road system lakes that are not currently stocked by ADF&G. Check the current sportfishing regulations booklet for an updated list of stocked lakes.\nWARNING: Lake ice conditions in late fall and winter can be very deceptive. Because of Kodiak's mild climate, the lake ice can be very thin. Always check ice thickness carefully. Trout fishing can be excellent when the lakes are ice free as well, as water temperatures cool down.\nKodiak's Remote Area\nSilver salmon returns to Remote Area streams are pretty much over by late October, but small numbers of fish are usually found through November in some of the later systems, particularly the Karluk River.\nThe big news for anglers interested in fly-out fishing in October is the runs of native steelhead trout. Peak time to fish is the end of the second week of October. Very few fish remain in late October. The Karluk, Ayakulik, Dog Salmon, and Litnik systems have the highest numbers of fish.\nFishing for resident rainbows should remain productive throughout the month in areas supporting sizable populations of fish, such as the Malina and Afognak rivers. Fishing Kodiak Island for rainbow/steelhead trout is open year round, with an annual limit of no more than 2, 20 inches or longer.

(Neither the ADF&G Permanent ID license nor the ADF&G Disabled Veteran's license expire.)\nThe sport fishing regulations are good through April 15 of the new year. Look for new booklets around March or early April.\nSaltwater Fishing\nHalibut fishing is closed January 1-31. After January, anglers will likely have a hard time catching large halibut because most fish are far offshore, spawning in deep water.\nRockfish are occasionally caught in Lower Cook Inlet while trolling for king salmon. Rockfish may be kept year-round. The daily bag limit in Cook Inlet is five rockfish, no more than one of which may be a non-pelagic species. Check the rockfish identification pages in the regulation booklet to identify non-pelagic species.\nLingcod fishing is open through December 31 but closed January 1 - June 30. The limits during December are two fish over 35 inches in length per day, or in possession. During the closed season, all lingcod caught accidentally must be landed by hand or with a net (no gaffs) and carefully released.\nSharks are occasionally caught in Cook Inlet. The season is open year-round. The bag and possession limit is one shark of any species, except for spiny dogfish which have a bag/possession limit of five fish. There is an annual limit of two sharks of any species, except for spiny dogfish which have no annual limit. All harvested sharks must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record. The most common sharks are the spiny dogfish (also called \"sand sharks\"), salmon sharks, and sleeper sharks. Sleeper sharks are generally inedible and should be released. Salmon sharks have high urea content and should be gutted and bled upon capture to ensure that the meat is edible. Spiny dogfish are a long-lived, slow to mature species that require long recovery times when stocks are over-exploited. Large and abrupt increases in the spiny dogfish population are unlikely because of their low reproductive rate. Spiny dogfish are highly migratory.\nSome anglers find success trolling for \"feeder\" king salmon throughout winter. Feeder kings are fish that are feeding in Lower Cook Inlet before returning to their home stream to spawn. Plastic hootchies or tube flies in green, chartreuse, or blue herring trolled behind dodgers/flashers are often effective, as are variously-colored spoons and spinners. Dressing the tackle with herring can improve success.\nAlthough there is no seasonal limit at this time of year, and king salmon don't have to be recorded until April 1, all king salmon bag and possession limits still apply. A king stamp IS still required (unless you have the ADF&G Senior License or ADF&G Disabled Veterans License, or unless you are under 16 years old).\nGood fishing for pollock and cod can also be found throughout Kachemak Bay. Other species that may be caught include Dolly Varden, greenlings, Irish lord, flounder, sole, and skate. TIP: Fishing during slack tide or relatively small tidal exchanges requires less lead (sinkers) to get to the bottom and will allow greater time anchored, all of which spells \"easier fishing.\"\nFreshwater Fishing\nStarting September 1, no bait or treble/multiple hooks are allowed in the Anchor River, Stariski Creek, Deep Creek, or Ninilchik River. Legal gear is single-hook, unbaited artificial lures/flies. A single hook has only 1 point. The ever-present Dolly Varden pretty much present the only fresh water possibility for winter fishing. Dollies will be overwintering in the deep pools or lakes along these systems. These streams are mostly frozen during this period, and have little open water. Proceed onto the ice with care because pockets of thin ice exist.\nThese streams close to all fishing January 1 through Memorial Day weekend (or the weekend before), to protect various populations of spawning salmon and trout. Please consult the sport fishing regulations before heading out to fish the Anchor River, Deep Creek, and the Ninilchik River.\nCaribou Lake is accessible by ski-equipped airplane or by snowmachine. Try fishing through the ice for Dolly Varden or kokanee. Leisure Lake also has a small population of rainbow trout. The ice conditions on either lake are not monitored by any state agency, and traveling on the ice is at your own risk.\nShellfish\nShrimp, crab - The shrimp and crab fisheries are closed year-round due to low population levels.\nClams - Only the hardiest clammers brave the weather, ice blocks and large breakers. You will need a lantern or strong flashlight if minus tides occur after 3 p.m. or before 10 a.m.\nButter and littleneck clams have different size and limit restrictions. Pictures in the sport fishing regulation book can help you learn to recognize the differences to avoid taking undersized butters. Bury your discarded clams neck up - they can't do it themselves and will die. Additionally, fill in any holes dug in search of clams for the protection of the other beach creatures in the hole and to prevent smothering animals under the beach gravel you have piled up.\nRazor clams: Beaches from the Kenai River to the tip of the Homer Spit is closed due to low population levels.\nOccasionally there are PSP advisories issued by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. Contact them at (907) 269-7629, or check out their PSP pages on the Internet.\nFor more information on fishing contact the Homer ADF&G Area Office at (907) 235-8191"

Feeder kings are fish from streams outside Cook Inlet that are feeding here before returning to their home stream to spawn. Plastic hootchies or tube flies in green, chartreuse, or blue herring trolled behind dodgers/flashers are often effective, as are variously-colored spoons and spinners. Dressing the tackle with herring can improve success.\nCertain salt waters from the Ninilchik River south to Bluff Point close to all fishing April 1 through June 30. Also, special harvest limits apply in some salt waters from Ninilchik to Bluff Point. These restrictions are in place to protect early run king salmon. Carefully check the “Cook Inlet salt water” section of the regulation book before heading out to fish.\nAll king salmon bag limits still apply. From April 1 through September 30, king salmon harvested need to be recorded on the back of your fishing license, and the 5 king seasonal limit applies. A king stamp IS required year-round (unless you have the ADF&G Senior License or ADF&G Disabled Veterans License, or unless you are under 16 years old).\nEager anglers ready for a change from ice fishing might want to try fishing off the tip of the Homer Spit in mid-April to early May for Dolly Varden. Try a small spinner, Swedish PimpleTM, or preserved salmon eggs. Snagging is not allowed at this time in Kachemak Bay.\nGood fishing for pollock and cod can also be found throughout Kachemak Bay. Other species that may be caught include Dolly Varden, greenling, Irish lord, flounder, sole, and skate. TIP: Fishing during slack tide or relatively small tidal exchanges require less lead (sinkers) to get to the bottom and will allow greater time anchored, all of which spells \"easier fishing.\"\nFreshwater Fishing\nThe Anchor River is closed to all fishing until the weekend before Memorial Day, while Deep Creek and the Ninilchik River are closed to all fishing until Memorial Day weekend, to protect various spawning salmon and trout. Please consult the sport fishing regulations before heading out to fish the Anchor River, Deep Creek, and the Ninilchik River.\nCaribou Lake is 9 miles from the road system and is sometimes fished through the ice for small Dolly Varden and an occassional kokanee. Leisure Lake, across Kachemak Bay, also has a small population of rainbow trout. The ice conditions on either lake are not monitored by any state agency, and traveling on the ice is at your own risk.\nShellfish\nShrimp, crab - The shrimp and crab fisheries are closed year-round due to low population levels.\nClams - Only the hardiest clammers brave the weather and large breakers. You will need a lantern or strong flashlight if minus tides occur after 6 p.m. or before 7 a.m.\nButter and littleneck clams have different size and limit restrictions. Pictures in the sport fishing regulation book can help you learn to recognize the differences to avoid taking undersized butters. Bury your discarded clams neck up - they can't do it themselves and will die if you don't. Additionally fill in any holes dug in search of clams for the protection of the other beach creatures in the hole and to prevent smothering animals under the beach material you have piled up.\nA sport-fishing license is required to harvest clams, including razor clams. There are literally miles of good razor clam beaches available from north of the Anchor River to Cape Stariski. The limit is the first 60 razor clams dug.\nOccasionally there are PSP advisories issued by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. Contact them at (907) 269-7640, or check out their PSP pages on the Internet.\nFor more information on fishing contact the Homer ADF&G Area Office at (907) 235-8191."

(Neither the ADF&G Permanent ID license nor the ADF&G Disabled Veteran's license expire.)\nHalibut\nAngler success usually improves greatly in May, with larger fish showing up in catches. Typical sizes range from 10 to 150 pounds. The halibut fishery should be in full swing by the end of May.\nA halibut that is kept counts towards the bag and possession limit OF THE PERSON WHO HOOKS IT, not the person who reels in the fish.\nFishing for Salmon in Salt Water \nNick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon - King salmon begin to show by mid-May, and numbers improve through early June. Spoons and spinners enhanced with salmon roe or herring are popular. Also, try fishing with only herring or roe.\nHalibut Cove and Seldovia - Ready for some majestic scenery, fewer people, and an easier pace than the Homer Spit? Try one of these boat- or plane access-only stocked king fisheries. King salmon begin to show by late May, with numbers building until the peak in early June.\nTrolling for King Salmon - Many anglers find success trolling for king salmon during May in near shore marine waters from Anchor Point to Ninilchik. A fair number of the king salmon caught in May are the larger spawners, heading back to their home streams in Cook Inlet. Feeder kings are also caught. Feeders are kings from streams outside Cook Inlet that are feeding before their eventual return to their home stream to spawn. Plastic hootchies or tube flies in green, chartreuse, or blue herring trolled behind dodgers/flashers are often effective, as are variously-colored spoons and spinners. Dressing the tackle with herring can improve success and fishing with only herring is also successful.\nCertain salt waters from the Ninilchik River south to Bluff Point close to all fishing April 1 through June 30. Also, special harvest limits apply in some salt waters from Ninilchik to Bluff Point. These restrictions are in place to protect early-run king salmon. Carefully check the “Cook Inlet salt water” section of the regulation book before heading out to fish.\nAll king salmon bag limits apply, and a 5-king seasonal limit is in effect from April 1 through September 30. Each king salmon you keep must be recorded, either on the back of your fishing license, or on a Harvest Record Card. Check the regulation booklet to see which harvest report you are required to have. A king stamp IS required year-round (unless you have the ADF&G Senior License or ADF&G Disabled Veterans License, or unless you are under 16 years old).\nOther Saltwater Opportunities\nRockfish are occasionally caught in Lower Cook Inlet while trolling for salmon or while fishing for halibut south of Point Pogibshi. Rockfish may be kept year-round. The bag limit in Cook Inlet is five rockfish, only one of which may be non-pelagic species. Most of the colorful species, such as the yelloweye rockfish (or \"red snapper\"), are in the non-pelagic category. Check the rockfish identification pages in the regulation booklet to identify non-pelagic species. Additional protection is needed for non-pelagic rockfishes because of their extreme longevity and low productivity. Anglers are encouraged to fish with a single hook and to avoid fishing in rocky areas so as to avoid catching non-pelagic rockfish. Rockfish caught in deep water suffer injuries from decompression. Recent research by the department indicates that survival of released rockfish can be substantially improved by releasing fish at the depth of capture. For more information on the types and use of deep water release mechanisms, see the department’s web page at http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingSportFishingInfo.rockfishconservation.\nLingcod fishing is closed Janurary 1- June 30. All lingcod caught accidentally must be landed without the use of a gaff and carefully released.\nSharks are occasionally caught in Cook Inlet. The season is open year-round. The bag and possession limit is one shark of any species, except for spiny dogfish which have a bag/possession limit of five fish. There is an annual limit of two sharks of any species, except for spiny dogfish which have no annual limit. All harvested sharks must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record. The most common sharks are the spiny dogfish (also called \"sand sharks\"), salmon sharks, and sleeper sharks. Sleeper sharks are generally inedible and should be released. Salmon sharks have high urea content and should be gutted and bled upon capture to ensure that the meat is edible. Spiny dogfish are a long-lived, slow to mature species that require long recovery times when stocks are ove-rexploited. Large and abrupt increases in the spiny dogfish population are unlikely because of their low reproductive rate. Spiny dogfish are highly migratory.\nPlease do not remove the head or tail until ADF&G port samplers have had a chance to measure your fish.\nGood fishing for pollock and cod can also be found throughout Kachemak Bay. Other species that may be caught include Dolly Varden, greenling, Irish lord, flounder, sole, and skate. TIP: Fishing during slack tide or relatively small tidal exchanges requires less lead (sinkers) to get to the bottom and will allow greater time anchored, all of which spells \"easier fishing.\"\nFresh Waters\nDeep Creek, Ninilchik River, and the Anchor River are open only on the weekends and the Mondays following those weekends. Check the regulation booklet for specific dates. A weekend is 12:01 a.m. Saturday through midnight Monday.\nWater conditions can vary greatly in these three rivers according to snowmelt and rainy weather.\nBait and multiple hooks are allowed in the salmon fishery on the Anchor River, Deep Creek, and Ninilchik River. Favorite lures include PixeesTM, KrocodilesTM, Okie DriftersTM, and Spin-N-GlosTM, all sweetened with a chunk of salmon roe or herring. Many anglers also fish salmon roe alone on a hook beneath a Corkie with enough weight to ensure their bait is bumping against the bottom.\nSpecial restrictions apply, so please consult the sport fishing regulations before heading out to fish the Anchor River, Deep Creek, and the Ninilchik River.\nKing salmon return to the Anchor River, Deep Creek and Ninilchik River from approximately early May through late July with a peak in June. Stream conditions on the Ninilchik River are generally less turbid than on the Anchor River and Deep Creek in May during fishery openings.  The Ninilchik River is stocked with hatchery reared king salmon in addition to having a wild run.  Hatchery reared kings are distinguished from wild fish by their adipose fin (a fleshy fin just before the tail); wild fish have an adipose fin while hatchery fish are missing their adipose fin and have a healed scar where the fin was removed.\nAs a result of the Ninilchik River stocking program, a hatchery-only fishery is allowed on the Ninilchik River in July.\r\n \nShellfish\nShrimp, crab - The shrimp and crab fisheries are closed year-round due to low population levels.\nClams - Many recreational clammers choose Memorial Day weekend for their first trip of the season to the clamming beaches.\nYour fishing license is required to take hardshell clams and for harvesting razor clams.\nButter and littleneck clams have different size and limit restrictions.

    "date": "Jun",
    "full_text": "June Season\nFreshwater Fishing\nAnchor River, Deep Creek, and the Ninilchik River are usually open in June, but are weekend-only fisheries (Saturday, Sunday, and Monday). Please check the regulation booklet for specific dates.\nThe king salmon fishing success at Anchor River, Deep Creek, and the Ninilchik River often depends on river conditions. The last two weekend openers are usually drier, and water levels have usually gone down from their spring flood highs. In addition, the second or third weekend openings often see more fish entering the rivers, as this is typically the peak of the king salmon return. On the Anchor River, the final weekend opener is often slow fishing because fewer fish are entering the river.\nOverall, king salmon catches improve each weekend until mid-month, then catches decline as the month wears on. These rivers tend to produce better fishing early in the day, but fishing success is also tide dependent. Anglers report that they start to catch fish around one to two hours before high tide, until about one hour after high tide.\nBait and multiple hooks are legal gear in these streams, with salmon roe preferred. Many king salmon anglers will add an Okie DrifterTM, Lil CorkieTM, Spin-n-GloTM, or orange or red yarn as an extra attractor. Anglers fishing without bait seem to prefer PixeesTM, KrokodilesTM, or TeeSpoonsTM. Whatever your preferred method, give it a try and if that doesn't work look around and see what the lucky ones are using.\nPlease consult the sport fishing regulations prior to fishing these streams.\nSaltwater Fishing\nSalmon\nThe June marine fishery for king salmon usually runs from poor to good, depending on the weather. Many kings are in the 15- to 25-pound range; occasionally fish weighing 40 pounds or more are reported. Spawning or mature fish represent a majority of the catch. Spawning kings tend to weigh in at 18-22 lbs., and fish smaller than that are typically \"feeders.\" Feeders are immature king salmon that will not spawn for several months or years and are feeding in near shore waters of Cook Inlet and Kachemak Bay.\nBy the end of the month, second-run kings start to show up in saltwater catches. The best bet when trolling for kings is fishing a herring behind a flasher in about 60 feet of water between Bluff Point and Anchor Point.\nThe stocked king salmon fisheries of Halibut Cove Lagoon require a boat for access. Seldovia may be reached by boat - regular air service is also available. Participating anglers are rewarded with majestic scenery, fewer anglers and a pleasant day away from the hustle and bustle. King salmon returns to these areas peak in mid-June, and the run is pretty much over by the end of June.\nMost of the action at Seldovia is centered near the bridge that crosses the Seldovia Slough. The harbor can also produce good catches. Trolling along the outside of the breakwater is effective for boat anglers, as is anchoring up in the slough at higher tide stages. The best chance of catching a fish here is on the ebb and flow of the tide. In Halibut Cove, most angling activity occurs from boats near the far end of the lagoon by the boat docks. Anglers also troll or cast on either end of the channel.\nBy late June, red (sockeye) salmon will enter the sheltered waters of China Poot Bay. These salmon are returning to an enhancement project financed by commercial fishermen. Not all are caught by their nets, though, and it’s possible for anglers to harvest some for their freezers. Higher concentrations of fish will be found near the mouth of China Poot Creek.\nAlso by the end of June, hatchery personnel at the small Tutka Bay lagoon usually see their first pink salmon of the year. These fish must first swim in Tutka Bay to return to the hatchery. Try cruising the shoreline in your Bayliner until you spot jumpers. Stop and cast a hot pink PixeeTM into the school and you can hardly go wrong.\nExcept for the Nick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon area, snagging is allowed in Kachemak Bay from June 24 through Dec. 31. Check the regulation booklet carefully. Before snagging is allowed, king salmon anglers cast out lures such as PixeesTM, Spin-N-GlosTM, or TeeSpoonsTM, sometimes adding salmon roe or fresh herring.\nNick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon - The king fishery begins in earnest in the first week of June. Because these fish are stocked into this saltwater lagoon, they have no freshwater stream to enter. These fish remain easily accessible and all will get caught. Many anglers, even some who have never before caught a king salmon, take their daily bag limit of two fish. Generally speaking, you can expect to catch a fish at this site just about any time of the day, but fishing is especially hot when the tide is flowing into the lagoon. Anglers have luck both inside and outside of the lagoon.\nPreferred bait is cut herring or salmon roe, sometimes suspended beneath a bobber if the tide is high. Anglers are reminded that this area remains closed to snagging until the Alaska Department of Fish and Game issues an Emergency Order (EO). Such an EO will be announced through the media and signs will be posted throughout the Fishing Lagoon area.\nGroundfish\nHalibut - Weather always plays a big part in bringing back fresh halibut. June is usually a calm month, but keep a watchful eye on weather and water conditions. Times of slack tide, or very little tidal interchanges often make it easier to keep your bait on the bottom.\nHalibut fishing in lower Cook Inlet (Homer and Seldovia) is expected to remain good this year. Although abundance throughout Southcentral Alaska is currently above the historical average, reproduction is down and abundance is believed to be decreasing.\nHalibut fishing should pick up a little in June, with slightly larger fish compared to May. Most charters run 15-50 miles from Homer and fish in 100-300 feet of water. Charter boat anglers can expect to catch fish in the 10-60 pound range, although an occasional larger fish, up to 200 pounds, will be landed. Private anglers fishing closer to port will do well in 80-150 feet of water. Popular spots include the bluffs on the north side of the outer bay, and the Glacier Spit area. Halibut taken closer to Homer are typically smaller, in the 10-40 pound range, with occasional larger fish up to 100 pounds or more.\nHalibut fishing in central Cook Inlet (Anchor Point and Ninilchik) is usually good in June, with many boats reporting limit catches. June also presents the opportunity to harvest halibut while trolling for king salmon. Most boats fish 70-300 feet of water. Expect most fish to be in the 10-30 pound range. The majority of larger fish come from deeper water farther offshore.\nA halibut that is kept counts towards the bag and possession limit OF THE PERSON WHO HOOKS IT, not the person who reels in the fish.\nRockfish are occasionally caught in Lower Cook Inlet while trolling for salmon or while fishing for halibut south of Point Pogibshi. Rockfish may be kept year-round. The bag limit in Cook Inlet is five rockfish, only one of which may be non-pelagic species. Most of the colorful species, such as the yelloweye rockfish (or \"red snapper\"), are in the non-pelagic category. Check the rockfish identification pages in the regulation booklet to identify non-pelagic species.

For more information on the types and use of deep water release mechanisms, see the department’s web page at http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingSportFishingInfo.rockfishconservation.\nLingcod fishing is closed until July 1 to protect male lingcod guarding their nests. Targeting lingcod, even for catch and release, is not allowed. All lingcod caught unintentionally must be landed without the use of a gaff and carefully released.\nSharks are occasionally caught in Cook Inlet. The season is open year-round. The bag and possession limit is one shark of any species, except for spiny dogfish which have a bag/possession limit of five fish. There is an annual limit of two sharks of any species, except for spiny dogfish which have no annual limit.

Other species that may be caught include Dolly Varden, greenling, Irish lord, flounder, sole, and skate. TIP: Fishing during slack tide or relatively small tidal exchanges requires less lead (sinkers) to get to the bottom and will allow greater time anchored, all of which spells \"easier fishing.\"\nThe Division of Sport Fish collects data on the recreational bottomfish harvest landed in Homer and on the beaches at Anchor Point and Deep Creek. Fishery technicians interview returning anglers and sample halibut, rockfish, and sharks for length, weight, sex, and age. You can help by providing information when interviewed and by allowing technicians to sample your catch. Information collected by this project is used to monitor the health of the fishery, advise halibut management agencies, and help the Alaska Board of Fisheries formulate regulations that protect fish stocks and provide maximum fishing opportunity. Contact ADF&G in Homer at (907) 235-1730 for additional information.\nShellfish\nShrimp and crab - The shrimp and crab fisheries are closed year-round, due to low population levels.\nClams - Lower Cook Inlet in June often sees at least one or two series of minus tides, the best times to dig for clams. Clam diggers are reminded that a sport-fishing license is needed to dig for clams. Butter and littleneck clams have different size and limit restrictions. Pictures in the sport fishing regulation book can help you learn to recognize the differences to avoid taking undersized butters. Additionally, it is a good practice to fill in any holes dug in search of clams, and to bury your discarded clams neck up.\nThere are literally miles of good razor clam beaches available from Bluff Point north to the mouth of the Kenai River. The limit is the first 60 razor clams dug. All razor clams dug must be kept.\nOccasionally there are PSP advisories issued by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.

    "full_text": "July Season\nHalibut\nHalibut fishing in July in the Lower Cook Inlet area is usually excellent, and slows only when the weather prohibits boats from visiting all their usual spots. Fish are taken anywhere from the shallow kelp beds at 25 feet to the 400- to 500-feet deep waters of Kennedy Entrance. Sizes range from 10 to 400 pounds. The choice bait in July for halibut is red (sockeye) salmon heads, but herring follows as a close second.\nHalibut fishing in lower Cook Inlet (Homer and Seldovia) is expected to remain good this year. Although abundance throughout Southcentral Alaska is currently above the historical average, reproduction is down and abundance is believed to be decreasing.\nA halibut that is kept counts towards the bag and possession limit OF THE PERSON WHO HOOKS IT, not the person who reels in the fish.\nSalmon\nIn July, the king salmon season is over in the Anchor River, Deep Creek, and the Ninilchik River. Even though there may still be a few king salmon in the lower sections of these streams, it is illegal to fish for them. Kings inadvertently caught must be released unharmed, immediately, and without removing them from the water.\nIn the salt water off of Deep Creek and the Anchor River, king salmon from the second run are not usually caught until mid-July. This run is sporadic, and success is often spotty. An occasional silver salmon can also be caught trolling the marine waters of these areas during late July.\nRegulations allow fishing in Anchor River, Deep Creek, Ninilchik River, and Stariski Creek ONLY in the lower two miles (approximately) of each stream. The upper reaches of these streams are closed to fishing through the end of July to protect spawning king salmon.\nBy mid-July, pink salmon start to enter these streams. They are an excellent way to introduce a novice to fishing, and pink salmon are excellent table fare, when fresh, as well. Look for silver salmon to start moving into Lower Kenai Peninsula streams by the end of July.\nBait and multiple hooks are legal gear in the sections of these streams open to salmon fishing, with salmon roe preferred. Anglers fishing without bait seem to prefer PixeesTM, KrokodilesTM, or TeeSpoonsTM. Whatever your preferred method, give it a try and if that doesn't work, look around and see what the lucky ones are using.\nNick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon - Look for silvers to show in the Lagoon around July 15. The run will build through early August. For the best success, fish the tide as it flows into the lagoon using egg clusters or cut herring. Spoons and spinners are also producers at any tide stage. During slack water periods try fishing cut herring below a bobber.\nChina Poot Bay - Red salmon enter this bay, located about 4 miles east of the Homer Spit, by the first of July. Commercial fishermen finance the stocking of this enhancement fishery, so they harvest as many fish as they can, but some are missed. Snagging of red salmon is allowed in salt waters outside the ADF&G marker at the mouth of China Poot Creek. The daily bag and possession limit is 6. Alaskan residents are allowed to use dip nets to harvest up to 6 red salmon per day upstream of the ADF&G marker in China Poot Creek. Remember: dipnetting is allowed only in the fresh waters of the creek upstream of the ADF&G marker! No permit is required, but you must have an Alaska resident fishing license. The tips of the tail fins must also be removed immediately, to mark the fish as personal use.\nOther locations - The third week of July is the time to begin fishing near Glacier Spit, located across Kachemak Bay from Homer, at the foot of Grewingk Glacier. Locals have fished this area for pink and silver salmon and halibut for decades. Try casting a hot pink PixeeTM from the shoreline, or if you prefer, trolling in tight to the beach. More adventurous anglers can find protected moorage in a small shallow saltwater embayment located on the spit. This allows boaters to fish from the beach or even to picnic, hike, or camp overnight.\nOther Saltwater Opportunities\nRockfish are occasionally caught in Lower Cook Inlet while trolling for salmon or while fishing for halibut south of Point Pogibshi. Rockfish may be kept year-round. The bag limit in Cook Inlet is five rockfish, only one of which may be non-pelagic species. Most of the colorful species, such as the yelloweye rockfish (or \"red snapper\"), are in the non-pelagic category. Check the rockfish identification pages in the regulation booklet to identify non-pelagic species.

For more information on the types and use of deep water release mechanisms, see the department’s web page at http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingSportFishingInfo.rockfishconservation.\nLingcod fishing opens July 1 with a limit of 2 lingcod daily or in possession. All harvested lingcod must be at least 35 inches in length.\nSharks are occasionally caught in Cook Inlet. The season is open year-round. The bag and possession limit is one shark of any species, except for spiny dogfish which have a bag/possession limit of five fish. There is an annual limit of two sharks of any species, except for spiny dogfish which have no annual limit. All harvested sharks must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record. The most common sharks are the spiny dogfish (also called \"sand sharks\"), salmon sharks, and sleeper sharks. Sleeper sharks are generally inedible and should be released. Salmon sharks have high urea content and should be gutted and bled upon capture to ensure that the meat is edible.

Dollies provide excellent action on light tackle. In the Anchor River, steelhead are at the end of their spawning period and the few straggling outmigrants could be hooked as they make their way back to salt waters. Spawning has greatly depleted their energy reserves. They should be landed quickly and carefully released. Doing so will greatly increase the chance that they will survive and return at a later date as larger fish to spawn.\nPlease consult the sport fishing regulations prior to fishing the Anchor River, Deep Creek, and Ninilchik River.\nShellfish\nShrimp and crab - The shrimp and crab fisheries are closed year-round due to low population levels.\nClams - Lower Cook Inlet in July often sees at least one or two series of minus tides, the best times to dig for clams. Clam diggers are reminded that a sport fishing license is needed to dig clams. Butter and littleneck clams have different size and limit restrictions. Pictures in the sport fishing regulation book can help you learn to recognize the differences to avoid taking undersized butters. Bury your discarded clams neck up - they can't do it themselves and will die. Additionally, fill in holes dug in search for the protection of the other beach creatures in the hole and to prevent smothering the ones under the pile you have dug.\nThere are literally miles of good razor clam beaches available from north of the Anchor River to Cape Kasilof. The limit is the first 60 razor clams dug. All razor clams dug must be kept.\nOccasionally there are PSP advisories issued by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.

    "full_text": "August Season\nHalibut\nEarly to mid-August sees some nice fish brought to Homer and Deep Creek, but angler success varies with the weather and the tides. Larger autumn tides make it hard to keep bait on the bottom. Most fish are between 10 and 100 pounds. Later in the month, weather often keeps boats from traveling far from port.\nA halibut that is kept counts towards the bag and possession limit OF THE PERSON WHO HOOKS IT, not the person who reels in the fish.\r\nFresh Waters - Anchor River, Deep Creek, Ninilchik River\nBy the end of the first week of August, silver salmon start to show in good numbers in these Lower Kenai Peninsula streams. Silvers reach their peak here around August 20, and are available after that through early September.\nPlease be careful to keep only the silvers! Some anglers confuse steelhead trout with silver salmon. Since steelhead/ rainbow trout are catch-and-release only in these streams, it is the angler's responsibility to be able to distinguish between steelhead/rainbow trout that must be released and silver salmon that may be kept. Check the fish ID pages in the regulation booklet. If it has spots on BOTH lobes of the tail and spots above and below the lateral line (the line running from head to tail down the center of the fish’s side), it is a steelhead/rainbow trout. If it has spots only on the UPPER lobe of the tail, it is a silver salmon.\nUntil September 1, bait and multiple hooks are legal gear in the sections of these streams open to salmon fishing, with salmon roe the preferred bait. Anglers fishing without bait seem to prefer smaller Spin-N-GlosTM, PixeesTM, KrocodilesTM, or TeeSpoonsTM. Whatever your preferred method, give it a try and if that doesn't work, look around and see what the lucky ones are using.\nPink salmon will also be available in these streams until mid-August.\nFishing for king salmon in these streams is closed for the season.\nIn August, Dolly Varden are also running in the Anchor, Deep Creek, and Ninilchik rivers. Dollies provide excellent action on light tackle.\nPlease consult the sport fishing regulations prior to fishing.\nSaltwater Salmon Fishing\nSaltwater trolling - Silver salmon are abundant in August and can be caught by trolling, weather permitting. Best results are often with downriggers, using flashers/dodgers and herring. It's still possible to pick up a late-run king salmon by trolling the salt waters from Bluff Point to the Ninilchik River in August but mostly you’ll find feeder kings (kings from streams outside of Cook Inlet that are here feeding before returning to their natal stream to spawn).\nNick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon - An early run of silver salmon will return from mid-July to mid-August, immediately followed by a late run of silvers. This provides almost continuous silver salmon action at the lagoon from July through mid-September. The peak of the late silver run to the lagoon is the third or fourth weeks of August. Try using salmon egg clusters or cut herring as well as spoons or spinners. Many anglers try their luck about 1-2 hours before high tide, when the water is rushing into the lagoon, through the high tide.\nSilver anglers also fish right off the tip of the Homer Spit, either casting spoons and spinners from shore, or trolling from a boat.\nChina Poot Bay - Red salmon continue to be available for snagging through the first week of August in this bay located about 4 miles east of the Homer Spit. A few pink salmon also return here, and are available in early August.\nOther locations - Fishing near Glacier Spit, located across Kachemak Bay from Homer, at the foot of Grewingk Glacier, is good in August for silver salmon. Try casting a hot pink PixeeTM from the shoreline, or if you prefer, troll close to the beach. You might pick up a feeder king if you troll along the shoreline here. More adventurous anglers can find protected moorage in a small shallow saltwater embayment located on the spit. This allows boaters to fish from the beach or even to picnic, hike, or camp overnight.\nOther Saltwater Opportunities\nRockfish are occasionally caught in Lower Cook Inlet while trolling for salmon or while fishing for halibut south of Point Pogibshi. Rockfish may be kept year-round. The bag limit in Cook Inlet is five rockfish, only one of which may be non-pelagic species. Most of the colorful species, such as the yelloweye rockfish (or \"red snapper\"), are in the non-pelagic category. Check the rockfish identification pages in the regulation booklet to identify non-pelagic species. Additional protection is needed for non-pelagic rockfishes because of their extreme longevity and low productivity. Anglers are encouraged to fish with a single hook and to avoid fishing in rocky areas so as to avoid catching non-pelagic rockfish. Rockfish caught in deep water suffer injuries from decompression. Recent research by the department indicates that survival of released rockfish can be substantially improved by releasing fish at the depth of capture. For more information on the types and use of deep water release mechanisms, see the department’s web page at \r\nhttp://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingSportFishingInfo.rockfishconservation.\r\n \nAdditional protection is needed for non-pelagic rockfishes because of their extreme longevity and low productivity. Anglers are encouraged to fish with a single hook and avoid fishing in rocky areas to minimize their catch of non-pelagic rockfish. Rockfish taken from more than 10 fathoms (60 feet) of water usually do not survive release, and should be retained if possible.\nLingcod fishing is open July 1 through December 31. The limit in Cook Inlet waters west of Gore Point is two lingcod daily or in possession. All lingcod must be at least 35 inches long.\nSharks are occasionally caught in Cook Inlet. The season is open year-round. The bag and possession limit is one shark of any species, except for spiny dogfish which have a bag/possession limit of five fish. There is an annual limit of two sharks of any species, except for spiny dogfish which have no annual limit. All harvested sharks must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record. The most common sharks are the spiny dogfish (also called \"sand sharks\"), salmon sharks, and sleeper sharks. Sleeper sharks are generally inedible and should be released. Salmon sharks have high urea content and should be gutted and bled upon capture to ensure that the meat is edible. Spiny dogfish are a long-lived, slow to mature species that require long recovery times when stocks are over-exploited. Large and abrupt increases in the spiny dogfish population are unlikely because of their low reproductive rate. Spiny dogfish are highly migratory.\nGood fishing for pollock and cod can also be found throughout Kachemak Bay. Other species that may be caught include Dolly Varden, greenlings, Irish lord, flounder, sole, and skate. TIP: Fishing during slack tide or relatively small tidal exchanges requires less lead (sinkers) to get to the bottom and will allow greater time anchored, all of which spells \"easier fishing.\"\nThe Division of Sport Fish collects data on the recreational bottomfish harvest landed in Homer and on the beaches at Anchor Point and Deep Creek. Fishery technicians interview returning anglers and sample halibut, rockfish, and sharks for length, weight, sex, and age. You can help by providing information when interviewed and by allowing technicians to sample your catch. Information collected by this project is used to monitor the health of the fishery, advise halibut management agencies, and help the Alaska Board of Fisheries formulate regulations that protect fish stocks and provide maximum fishing opportunity. Contact Barbi Failor in Homer at (907) 235-1730 for additional information.\nShellfish\nShrimp, crab - The shrimp and crab fisheries are closed year-round due to low population levels.\nClams - Lower Cook Inlet has low minus tides in August, but the minus tides usually arrive later in the day. By mid- to late August, you might need a lantern or strong flashlight. Minus tides are the best ones to dig for clams because more beach area is exposed.\nYou will also need a sport fishing license to dig clams. Butter and littleneck clams have different size and limit restrictions. Pictures in the sport fishing regulation book can help you learn to recognize the differences to avoid taking undersized butters. Bury your discarded clams neck up - they can't do it themselves and will die. Additionally, fill in any holes dug in search of clams for the protection of the other beach creatures in the hole and to prevent smothering animals under the pile you’ve dug out of the hole.\nThere are literally miles of good razor clam beaches available from north of the Anchor River to Cape Kasilof. The limit is the first 60 razor clams dug. All razor clams dug must be kept.\nOccasionally there are PSP advisories issued by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. Contact them at (907) 269-7629, or check out their PSP pages on the Internet.\nFor more information on fishing contact the Homer ADF&G Area Office at (907) 235-8191."

Halibut caught this time of year are typically in the 10-50 pound range.\nA halibut that is kept counts towards the bag and possession limit OF THE PERSON WHO HOOKS IT, not the person who reels in the fish.\nFresh Waters - Anchor River, Deep Creek, Ninilchik River\nStarting September 1, no bait or treble/multiple hooks are allowed in these streams. Legal gear is single-hook, unbaited, artificial lures/flies. A single hook has only 1 point.\nAlthough past the peak, fair numbers of silver salmon will continue to enter the Anchor River, Deep Creek, Ninilchik River, and Stariski Creek until mid- to late September. Popular lures include single-hook PixeesTM, single-hook Okie DriftersTM, and any brightly-colored, flashy fly.\nSteelhead fishing on the Anchor River nears its peak in mid-September. Deep Creek and Ninilchik River also support a very small run of these sea-run trout. This is a catch-and-release ONLY fishery, and rainbow/steelhead trout may not be removed from the water. A good way to record your catch on film is for both the angler and the photographer to kneel in the water, with the fish held in the water.\nDolly Varden continue to be available through ice-up. Dollies provide excellent action on light tackle.\nCertain waters are open to salmon fishing, and certain waters are closed. Please consult the sport fishing regulations before heading out to fish the Anchor River, Deep Creek, and the Ninilchik River.\nSaltwater Salmon Fishing\nDeep Creek trolling - If the weather is good, many anglers have fair to excellent success trolling for silver salmon between Stariski Creek and the Ninilchik River. Trolling around Bluff Point is also productive. Best results are often with downriggers, using flashers/dodgers and herring.\nNick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon – Although it’s the downslope of the run, silvers continue to trickle into the lagoon until mid-September. Most silvers are caught fishing either the flooding high or ebbing low tides. Silver anglers also fish from the tip of the Homer Spit, either casting spoons and spinners from shore, or trolling from a small boat. The fishing lagoon opens to snagging by emergency order in mid-September if there are enough fish left.

Dolly Varden also continue to be available through ice-up. Dollies provide excellent action on light tackle until ice clogs the river (and the guides of your fishing rod).\nSaltwater Salmon Fishing\nAnglers sometimes find success trolling for \"feeder\" king salmon throughout late fall and early winter. Feeder kings are fish that are feeding in Lower Cook Inlet, preparing for their eventual return to their home stream. Plastic hootchies or tube flies in green, chartreuse, or blue trolled behind dodgers/flashers are often effective, as are variously-colored spoons and spinners. Dressing the tackle with herring can improve success.\nThere is no seasonal limit south of Bluff Point from October through the end of March, but all daily bag limits and possession limits still apply. A king stamp is still required (unless you have the ADF&G Senior License or ADF&G Disabled Veterans License, or unless you are under 18 years old).\nNick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon - The salmon runs here are over for the year.

Rapidly increasing temperatures anticipated on the North Slope later this week will accelerate snowmelt and bring rivers up quickly. By next week, Norton Sound rivers should drop and clear up enough to fish. Most lakes are still mostly ice-covered, with open leads around the perimeter.\nSport Fishing\nResident Species\n\nAnglers are starting to target Dolly Varden and Arctic grayling on the Snake and Sinuk Rivers as they feed on outmigrating salmon fry. Smolt imitation flies work best, but small jigs and spoons can work, too. It will be a week or two before river conditions in the Kotzebue and North Slope drainages are suitable for fishing.\nFishing for Arctic char, lake trout, and Arctic grayling in North Slope lakes can be good in the open leads along the shore while the water is still cold, but the lake trout and Arctic char will move into deeper water as the temperatures rise later in the summer.\nNorthern pike should be about done spawning now and will soon disperse to feeding areas. The Kuzitrin and Pilgrim Rivers near Nome are good spots, as are the many sloughs and off-channel oxbow lakes of the larger Kobuk, Selawik, and Noatak Rivers.\nSheefish begin their upstream migration to the spawning grounds in the Kobuk and Selawik Rivers around July 1, and fish can be caught near the Kobuk River villages of Noorvik and Kiana about a week later.\n\nSalmon\n\nSalmon have begun to enter the nearshore waters in Norton Sound, but it will be another week or two before they begin to enter area rivers. Kotzebue Sound typically doesn’t see salmon until early-July.\n\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the Emergency Orders and Advisory Announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip:\n\nEmergency Order 3-KS-W-03-24 Closes sport fishing for king salmon in all fresh waters from Bald Head to Point Romanof.

Most salmon counting projects in Norton Sound are coming on-line. Projects on the Nome, Eldorado, Ungalik, Kwiniuk, Shaktoolik, Unalakleet, and North Rivers are fully operational, as is the sockeye smolt counting project on the Pilgrim River. Projects on the Snake and Niukluk Rivers should be up by the weekend unless the water comes up dramatically.\n\nSport Fishing\nResident Species\n\nAnglers are targeting Dolly Varden and Arctic grayling on the Snake, Pilgrim, and Sinuk Rivers as they feed on the remaining outmigrating salmon fry. Smolt imitation flies work best, but small jigs and spoons can work, too. Now is a great time to catch large Arctic grayling on topwater flies, before eggs from spawning salmon become their food of choice. Elk-hair caddis, blue duns, mosquito patterns should all work well.\nFishing for Arctic char, lake trout, and Arctic grayling in North Slope lakes can be good along the shore while the water is still cold, but lake trout and Arctic char will move into deeper water as the temperatures rise later in the summer.\nNorthern pike fishing is really good now as fish disperse to summer feeding areas. The Kuzitrin and Pilgrim Rivers near Nome are good spots, as are the many sloughs and off-channel oxbow lakes of the larger Kobuk, Selawik, and Noatak Rivers.\nSheefish have been caught in the Kobuk River near the villages of Kiana and Noorvik. It will be a couple of weeks before they reach the village of Kobuk. Fishing should continue to improve.\nNo reports for the Noatak River but the residents of Kivalina are catching Dolly Varden in the Wulik River. Fishing will slow dramatically as the overwintering fish leave and will pick up again in August. In the Noatak, spawners will begin to arrive in spawning tributaries of the Kelly, Kugururok, and Nimiuktuk next week.\n\nSalmon\n\nLarge numbers of pink salmon have been observed in the lower Unalakleet River and in the nearshore marine waters in front of town. The SEG of 25,000 fish at the North River tower was surpassed on July 2 and 120,000 fish have passed the tower as of July 8. The bag and possession limit for pink salmon was increased from 10 to 20 fish in the Unalakleet River drainage, effective July 3. It should be a good year for pink salmon throughout Norton Sound.\nCounts of Chinook and chum salmon have been low, but it’s early for chums and counts are near historical averages. Chinook salmon fishing will remain closed for the season, and coho salmon should start showing up in about two weeks.\n\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the Emergency Orders and Advisory Announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip:\n\nEmergency Order 3-KS-W-03-24 issued on March 19 closed sport fishing for king salmon in all fresh waters from Bald Head to Point Romanof.

Salmon counting projects in Norton Sound have been hampered on and off all summer with high water but all projects are currently operational. Projects on the Nome, Eldorado, Snake, Niukluk, Ungalik, Kwiniuk, Shaktoolik, Unalakleet, and North Rivers will operate until late-summer rains bring water levels up too high to count fish.\nSport Fishing\nResident Species\n\nFishing for Arctic grayling has been good in streams throughout Norton Sound. Small spinners as well as smolt imitation and dry flies will work well. Soon, egg-imitation lures and flies will become productive as salmon spawning commences.\nFishing for northern pike has been great as the water levels have dropped and fish have moved into off-channel habitats of the Pilgrim, Kuzitrin, Selawik, and Kobuk Rivers. Big spoons and soft baits work well for northern pike, as do large topwater lures and flies.\nNorth Slope rivers are running low and clear in most places and fishing for Arctic grayling should be good. Fishing for Arctic char, lake trout, and Arctic grayling in North Slope lakes has been good but the lake trout and Arctic char will move into deeper water as the temperatures rise during mid-day.\nFishing effort for burbot has historically been low in the NW/NSMA but large fish can be found in many North Slope rivers and lakes. These are almost exclusively caught with cut bait fished on the bottom.\n\nAnadromous Species\n\nCounting projects for salmon in Norton Sound are up and running. King salmon were not projected to meet the escapement goal on the North River, and king salmon fishing throughout southern Norton Sound was closed by emergency order on March 28.\nPink salmon runs have been larger than average, and the daily bag and possession limit for pink salmon was increased by emergency order from 10 to 20 fish on July 3.\nChum salmon counts are below average in northern Norton Sound, and it looks unlikely that escapement goals will be met in the Snake and Nome Rivers. However, the run into the Unalakleet River drainage has been very good.\nSheefish have begun their upstream migration to the spawning grounds in the Kobuk and Selawik Rivers, and fish have been caught near the upriver spawning areas. Spawning generally occurs in late-September, just before freeze-up.\nSpawning runs of Dolly Varden have begun upstream migration in Northwestern and North Slope rivers, and fish will trickle in through August. The Noatak and Wulik Rivers are the most popular spots for large Dolly Varden, with fish over 15 pounds possible in both drainages.\n\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the Emergency Orders and Advisory Announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip:\n\nEmergency Order 3-KS-W-03-24 issued on March 19 closed sport fishing for king salmon in all fresh waters from Bald Head to Point Romanof. This closure includes, but is not limited to, the Unalakleet, Shaktoolik, Koyuk, Ungalik, Inglutalik, and Golsovia river drainages. In addition, only one unbaited, single-hook, artificial lure may be used in these drainages. All king salmon caught incidentally in the waters described above while fishing for other species may not be removed from the water and must be released immediately.\nEmergency Order 3-PS-W-012-24 issued on July 1 increases the sport fish bag and possession limit for pink salmon from 10 to 20 fish in the Unalakleet River drainage in Northwest Alaska.\n\n\n\nAdditional Tips\n\nBecause fish typically grow and reproduce more slowly at high latitudes and elevations, please use proper catch-and-release techniques when engaging in catch-and-release fishing in order to ensure the survival of the released fish such as:\r\n\r\n\t\nUse lures with a single hook and crimp down the barb. Do not use bait.\nLand the fish with a soft net and keep the fish in the water when removing the hook.\nTo release the fish, hold it gently facing into the current or in water without a current gently cradle the fish and move it slowly back and forth until it swims away under its own power.\n\n\n\nADF&G News\nYou also purchase licenses through the ADF&G online store and print it off at home. Make sure to review emergency orders, advisory announcements, and the 2024 Northern Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary Booklet for the area you are fishing before you head out.\nFor More Information\nCall Northwest and North Slope Area Management Biologist Brendan Scanlon at (907) 459-7268."

Rapidly increasing temperatures anticipated on the North Slope this week will accelerate snowmelt and bring rivers up quickly. Norton Sound rivers are dropping and clearing up nicely. Most lakes are still mostly ice-covered, with open leads around the perimeter.\nSport Fishing\nResident Species\n\nAnglers are starting to target Dolly Varden and Arctic grayling in Norton Sound Rivers as they feed on outmigrating salmon fry. Smolt imitation flies work best, but small jigs and spoons can work, too. Fishing for Dollies has been particularly good on the Sinuk, Pilgrim, Nome, and Unalakleet Rivers. It will be a week or two before river conditions in the Kotzebue and North Slope drainages are suitable for fishing.\nFishing for Arctic char, lake trout, and Arctic grayling in North Slope lakes can be good in the open leads along the shore while the water is still cold, but the lake trout and Arctic char will move into deeper water as the temperatures rise later in the summer.\nNorthern pike should be about done spawning now and will soon disperse to feeding areas. The Kuzitrin and Pilgrim Rivers near Nome are good spots, as are the many sloughs and off-channel oxbow lakes of the larger Kobuk, Selawik, and Noatak Rivers.\nSheefish begin their upstream migration to the spawning grounds in the Kobuk and Selawik Rivers around July 1, and fish can be caught near the Kobuk River villages of Noorvik and Kiana about a week later.\n\nSalmon\n\nNo reports of salmon in the nearshore waters in Norton Sound yet, and it will be at least another week or two before they begin to enter area rivers. Kotzebue Sound typically doesn’t see salmon until early-July.\n\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the Emergency Orders and Advisory Announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip:\n\nEmergency Order 3-KS-W-04-25  Closes sport fishing for king salmon in all fresh waters from Bald Head to Point Romanof.

Conversely, a late-season snowstorm followed by hot weather on the North Slope brought rivers up above flood stage, and most North Slope rivers are still too high for safe fishing or boating. Most lakes in the Norton Sound and Kotzebue areas are open, while most North Slope lakes are ice covered with open leads around the perimeter.\nSport Fishing\nResident Species\n\nFishing for Arctic grayling and Dolly Varden has been very good in Norton Sound streams. Smolt imitation flies work best, but small jigs and spoons can work, too. Fishing for Dollies has been particularly good on the Sinuk, Pilgrim, Nome, and Unalakleet Rivers. Fishing with dry flies on the Niukluk and Fish Rivers has been excellent for grayling. It will be a week or two before river conditions in North Slope drainages are suitable for fishing.\nMost Dolly Varden have moved out of their overwintering areas in the Wulik, Noatak, and Kivalina Rivers on their way to marine feeding areas, or back to their natal streams to spawn. Fishing in rivers will pick up after July 1 and will stay good through September.\nFishing for Arctic char, lake trout, and Arctic grayling in North Slope lakes can be good in the open leads along the shore while the water is still cold, but the lake trout and Arctic char will move into deeper water as the temperatures rise later in the summer.\nNorthern pike are done spawning and should be nice and hungry.

You can purchase and display your fishing license and king stamp, record your annual harvest (i.e. king salmon), access sport fishing regulations and locations, and much more on your mobile device. You can also purchase licenses through the ADF&G online store and print it off at home. Make sure to review emergency orders, advisory announcements, and the 2024 Northern Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary Booklet for the area you are fishing before you head out.\nLocal Conditions\nJune 2024 has started with extremely high water on the Kuskokwim River and in Kuskokwim Bay. Sport fishing and rod-and-reel subsistence fishing is nearly impossible currently due to high flow and turbidity. In addition, a late-arriving spring has made the arrival of king salmon and sheefish into the rivers about two weeks later than usual.\nKuskokwim River Tributaries\n*Note: Presence of a particular fish species does not necessarily mean that it is legal to fish for that species. In addition, some waters have terminal tackle restrictions and all have bag and possession limits that may differ between drainages. Please consult current sport fishing regulations for the waters in which you plan to fish. Sometimes sport fishing regulations are modified inseason, usually in the case of salmon. Please review any “Emergency Orders” issued in the area you are planning to fish prior to wetting your line.\nSalmon\n\nBelow-average king salmon returns are expected this season. The Kuskokwim River drainage (not including the Kuskokwim Bay streams, i.e. the Kanektok, Goodnews, and Arolik Rivers) is closed to king salmon fishing pre-season and is expected to remain closed throughout the season. King, chum, and coho salmon fishing was closed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and opportunities to fish for those species is restricted to local subsistence users. Sport fishing for other species remains open. King salmon are entering the Kuskokwim Bay streams, though it is a cold and late spring and they are about two weeks late. They typically enter the rivers starting in mid-May.\n\nResident Species\n\nWater in all Kuskokwim River drainages remains very high, with lots of debris. However, good fishing opportunities can be expected later as water levels continue to decrease. Many of the local rivers support sheefish, Dolly Varden, burbot, rainbow trout, northern pike and Arctic grayling.\nNorthern pike fishing improves throughout June as they recover from the rigors of spawning. Anglers will find northern pike in shallow waters that are adjacent to cooler, deeper waters.\nFishing for burbot at the mouths of Kuskokwim River tributaries is a common, local practice. Setlines are allowed for burbot fishing.\nSheefish migrate up the Kuskokwim River drainage in May and June, and often can be caught with hook and line at the mouths of clear tributaries.\nLocal high elevation lakes can provide excellent fishing opportunities for Arctic char/lake trout and Dolly Varden during the early morning or late evening hours. Try fishing near outlets and inlets or off points of land that are adjacent to deep waters.\n\nKuskokwim Bay Tributaries\nSalmon\n\nSport fishing for king salmon remains open in the Kuskokwim Bay, but please check for announcements throughout the season. In years that are open to king salmon fishing, sport fishing for king salmon in the Kuskokwim Bay streams generally continues to improve throughout June. The Kanektok, Arolik and Goodnews River king salmon runs peak in the lower sections of these rivers during the last week of June. Anglers can expect to find fair numbers of king salmon in the mid reaches of the Kuskokwim Bay streams by the end of June.\nSockeye salmon begin to enter local Kuskokwim Bay streams in the lower sections in early June. Generally the sockeye salmon run peaks before mid-July in the lower reaches of Kuskokwim Bay streams.\nFishing for chum salmon in the Kanektok River has been closed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the month of June.\n\nResident Species\n\nDolly Varden and rainbow trout fishing this time of year is generally good, but is highly dependent on fishing conditions, particularly water clarity. The high elevation lakes offer excellent fishing for char/lake trout and Dolly Varden as soon as the ice is out.\n\nBest Practices\nDuring these times of salmon conservation, it is important to use best practices when handling fish, especially if a fish is accidentally caught that is in a closed fishery. These practices include:\n\nKeeping the fish in the water\nUsing single-hook lures or flies\nWhen taking pictures, cradle the fish with both hands\nPinching your barbs down\nIf you cannot remove the fly easily, consider cutting the line or the hook\n\nEnjoy these western Alaska fishing opportunities, operate boats in courteous manner, pack out your waste and only leave your footprints. Good luck fishing!\nFor more information, please call the Kuskokwim-Goodnews Area Manager John Chythlook at (907) 459-7361."

Please contact their office in Bethel at (907) 543-3151 for more information.\nSheefish\nSheefish are catchable at the mouths of many clearwater rivers such as the Aniak and Holitna Rivers, as well as other clearwater streams near Bethel such as the Kwethluk and Kisaralik Rivers. Large colorful spoons and spinners work well for these. Initially, high water levels have given way to more average levels and clarity which has contributed to better catchability.\nRainbow Trout\nRainbow trout catches are currently reported as fair in both the sport fisheries and the subsistence rod-and-reel fisheries. These popular fisheries occur in the Kuskokwim Bay Rivers - Goodnews, Kanektok, and Arolik, and in the lower Kuskokwim drainages that include the Kisaralik, Kwethluk, Kasigluk, and Aniak Rivers. These are popular guided and outfitted fisheries in remote Alaska, with many private businesses that provide excellent services and opportunities.\nDolly Varden\nDolly Varden catches have been reported to be spotty to poor in many Kuskokwim River tributaries.\nNorthern Pike\nNorthern pike fishing has been excellent with increasing water clarity as the high water conditions have decreased. Any clearwater mouth or connected slough complex along the mainstem Kuskokwim River affords excellent fishing. Anything that imitates prey and attracts attention will work. Crocodiles and larges spoons work anytime, and topwater lures such as jitterbugs and large fly patterns work best in late evening under the midnight sun when the large pike will lurk in the warm surface waters.\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the Emergency Orders and Advisory Announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip:\n\nEmergency Order 3-KS-V-03-25 closes the Kuskokwim River drainage to sport fishing for king salmon.\n\nBest Practices\nDuring these times of salmon conservation, it is important to use best practices when handling fish, especially if a fish is accidentally caught that is in a closed fishery. These practices include:\n\nKeeping the fish in the water\nUsing single-hook lures or flies\nWhen taking pictures, cradle the fish with both hands\nPinching your barbs down\nIf you cannot remove the fly easily, consider cutting the line or the hook\n\nEnjoy these western Alaska fishing opportunities, operate boats in courteous manner, pack out your waste and only leave your footprints. Good luck fishing!\nADF&G News\nDon’t forget to bring your 2025 sport fishing license. You may purchase your sport fishing license online at the ADF&G Online Store. Also, be sure to review Emergency Orders and the 2025 Northern Sport Fishing Regulations Summary Booklet for the area you are fishing before you head out.\nFor more information, please call Kuskokwim-Goodnews Area Manager John Chythlook at (907) 459-7361."

Rivers and streams within the Yukon River Area are running high and muddy and will continue to do so for another week or more as there is still ample snow in the higher elevations that will continue to melt with increasing ambient temperatures.\nThe Steese, Dalton, and Taylor Highways are open for travel. Driving conditions on the Steese and Taylor Highways are rated as fair to good. Current Dalton Highway conditions are rated fair to difficult. Drivers should be careful of large potholes and washout sections. Current Alaska road conditions can be found at Alaska 511.\n\nFreshwater Fishing\nArctic grayling\nArctic grayling are fairly ubiquitous throughout the Yukon River drainage.\n\nNome Creek is a popular Arctic grayling sport fishery that can be accessed from the Steese Highway. In lower Nome Creek and other lower Beaver Creek tributaries, Arctic grayling are concluding late May spawning activities and post-spawning fish will soon migrate into upper tributary summer feeding areas, which will afford good sport fishing opportunities once streams clear. NOME CREEK IS RESTRICTED TO CATCH-AND-RELEASE FISHING ONLY FOR ARCTIC GRAYLING.\nBirch Creek can also be accessed from the Steese Highway and is also referred to by its Gwitchin’ Athabascan name, the Ikhèenjik (Ih-hey-n-jik) River. Currently the road to access the Upper Birch Creek wayside (MP 94.1) is impassable with mud and deep ruts. Also, for those planning to float Birch Creek, be aware that during 2023 a potentially hazardous new river channel was discovered a few miles downriver from the Upper Birch Creek Wayside that required an approximately ¼ mile portage. Before visiting and/or floating from this wayside, call the Bureau of Land Management Fairbanks District office at 907-474-2200.\nStreams within the Fortymile River drainage that are accessible from the Taylor Highway will also afford good fishing opportunities once the water clears.\nDalton Highway streams are further north and are running high and turbid with melting snow and the Arctic grayling are in the midst of spawning activities. The best fishing opportunities along the Dalton Highway are between July to mid-September.\nPopular gear used to capture Arctic grayling are shiny spoons when the streams are wide enough and colorful jigs for narrower streams and creeks. Mosquitos are just beginning to appear in the upper tributaries of Nome and Beaver Creeks, Ikhèenjik River, and Taylor Highway streams, and flies mimicking these pesty blood-suckers would also be enticing to a hungry Arctic grayling that did not feed during spawning activities.\nWatch our video How to Fish for Arctic grayling to learn what you will need to know to successfully target Arctic grayling.\n\nNorthern pike\nNorthern pike are also concluding spawning activities and, like Arctic grayling, are fairly ubiquitous throughout the Yukon River drainage.\n\nGood fishing for northern pike can be found in slower moving waters like the lower portion of the Ikhèenjik River that crosses at mile 147 of the Steese Highway.\nOther popular fishing locations for large Northern pike are at the mouths of major tributaries that drain into the mainstem Yukon River such as the Dall, Ray, Nowitna, and Innoko Rivers, and Hess Creek. The Yukon River is currently running high and muddy with lots of debris. Sport fishing conditions will improve for these voracious, visual predators once the water lowers and clears at the mouths of these tributaries.\nPopular lures that fishers have reported success in capturing northern pike include buzzbait, booyah, jitterbugs, shiny spoons, and shads. Northern pike have rows of sharp teeth, so be sure to bring pliers and a spreader in order to safely remove hooks, especially from larger fish.\n\nSheefish\n\n\nSheefish that have overwintered in the lower Yukon River are migrating upstream to summer feeding areas and as the water in the Yukon River drops and clears, good fishing opportunities will be found at the mouths of major tributaries such as the Innoko, Koyukuk, Nowitna, and Porcupine Rivers. Large, shiny spoons such as crocodiles, pixies, and daredevils, as well as various shads that mimic juvenile prey, are popular lures for capturing sheefish\n\nSalmon\nKing salmon\n\n\nDue to a preseason projection for a below-average king salmon run in the Yukon River, sport fisheries for king salmon is closed in the Yukon Management. This closure prohibits all sport fishing for king salmon, including catch-and-release fishing. In addition, when fishing for other species, anglers may not use bait in Yukon River tributaries.\nBecause king salmon runs in the Yukon River continue to experience historically low runs, including those crossing the border into Canada where approximately 40-50% of the salmon spawn, a 7-year agreement has been enacted to close Canadian-origin Yukon River Chinook salmon to all fishing, including subsistence, commercial, personal use, and sport fishing during 2024-2030. This agreement applies only to Canadian-origin king salmon and if inseason stock assessment information indicates that king salmon escapement goals and subsistence needs will be met, sport fishing restrictions may be relaxed in Yukon River tributaries commensurate with run strengths.\n\nChum salmon\n\nFor summer chum salmon, the preseason forecast is for a run of sufficient size to meet spawning run goals. However, given the recent closures due to poor run sizes, the fishery manager will be keeping a close eye on counts conducted at the Pilot Station sonar and if the ¼ point of the run shows that the run strength will be insufficient, then the sport fishery will be closed. Be sure to check the Emergency Orders and Advisory Announcements before fishing for chum salmon in the Yukon River.\n\nEmergency orders\n\n\nPlease review the Emergency Orders and Advisory Announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip:\n\nEmergency Order 3-KS-Y-1-2024 closes the Yukon River drainage excluding the Tanana River drainage, to sport fishing for king salmon.\n\nCatch-and-release techniques\n\nBecause fish typically grow and reproduce more slowly at high latitudes and elevations, please use proper catch-and-release techniques to ensure the survival of the released fish such as:\r\n\r\n\t\nUse lures with a single hook and crimp down the barb. Do not use bait.\nLand the fish with a soft net and keep the fish in the water when removing the hook.\nTo release the fish, hold it gently facing into the current or in water without a current to gently cradle the fish and move it slowly back and forth until it swims away under its own power.\n\n\n\nFor More Information\nFor moe information, please call Yukon Area Management Biologist Lisa Stuby at 907-459-7202."

A large fire has been burning near the Elliott Highway, although recent rain has helped calm fire activity. The fire is still smoldering and hotter, drier weather is forecasted. Before driving to the Dalton Highway, check the current road conditions at Alaska 511 for updates on road closures on this changing and emerging situation. Dense smoke may be present from this and other potentially emerging wildfires along the Dalton and Steese Highways. Be careful with any fire sources when fishing and camping during hot, dry, and windy conditions. Road conditions along the Taylor Highway are currently good; however, be aware the first 60 miles of the Taylor Highway are paved, and the remaining sections are gravel.\n\nFreshwater Fishing\nArctic grayling\nArctic grayling are fairly ubiquitous throughout the Yukon River drainage.\n\nPost-spawning Arctic grayling will be at their summer feeding locations where they will remain throughout most of July and August. In general, older and larger adult Arctic grayling will occupy the upper reaches of a river or stream, gradating to smaller adults and juveniles lower in the drainages. Many of the streams accessed from the Steese, Dalton, and Taylor Highways are headwaters.\nNome Creek and the Ikhèenjik River (Birch Creek), which can be accessed from the Steese Highway, are running low and clear and offer excellent fishing opportunities for Arctic grayling. Only catch-and-release fishing for Arctic grayling is allowed in Nome Creek, which is located within the White Mountains National Recreation Area. NOME CREEK IS RESTRICTED TO CATCH-AND-RELEASE FISHING ONLY FOR ARCTIC GRAYLING.

This agreement applies only to Canadian-origin king salmon in the mainstem Yukon River. Current run projects for king salmon indicate another poor run and sport fishing will remain closed for the remainder of 2024.\n\nChum salmon\n\nFor summer chum salmon, current projections are for a run of sufficient size to meet spawning run goals. However, there remains uncertainty about the run strength projection for fall chum salmon, which typically appear in the lower Yukon River during mid-July.

Rain along with truck traffic servicing Prudhoe Bay has created large potholes on the Dalton Highway. Also, there is extensive roadwork being conducted on the Elliott and Dalton Highways to Coldfoot. Therefore, expect to drive slowly and expect at least four flagging and pilot car operations. Road conditions on the Steese Highway are fair to good and conditions are better on the Taylor Highway. You can check the current road conditions at Alaska 511. The current rain has risen the streams along these highways, leading to high, muddy water conditions. Fishing will improve as the rains subside and the streams lower and clear.\nFreshwater Fishing\nArctic grayling\n\nArctic grayling are currently at their summer feeding locations where they will remain throughout most of August before beginning their fall migration to overwintering areas during mid- to late-September as the weather cools. In general, the older and larger adult Arctic grayling will occupy the upper reaches of a river or stream, gradating to smaller adults and juveniles lower in the drainages. Many of the streams accessed from the Steese, Dalton, and Taylor Highways are headwaters and are currently running high due to recent rain. However, these headwaters streams tend to decrease rather rapidly with drier weather.\n\n\nNome Creek and the Ikhèenjik River (Birch Creek), which can be accessed from the Steese Highway, offer excellent fishing opportunities for Arctic grayling when the water is running at normal height and clear.

Difficult driving conditions continue for the Dalton Highway as the August rains along with truck traffic servicing Prudhoe Bay has created large potholes. Also, there is extensive roadwork being conducted on the Elliott Highway to the start of the Dalton Highway at Milepost 73. Therefore, expect to drive slowly and expect flagging and pilot car operations. Road conditions on the Steese Highway are good to fair and that for the Taylor Highway are fair. You can check the current road conditions at Alaska 511.\nDuring late summer and early fall, bears will be fattening up on berries in preparation for winter hibernation. So, be especially alert when fishing near large berry patches. Here is some information on staying safe in bear country: Traveling in Alaska's Bear Country.\nLastly, be aware in Interior Alaska that moose hunting season will begin on September 1 and depending on the location, will go to late September. When fishing where there could be hunters, be sure to wear bright colors.\nFreshwater Fishing\nArctic grayling\n\nArctic grayling will begin their fall migrations to overwintering areas in deeper water during mid to late September as the weather cools and water levels drop. Arctic grayling in streams along the Dalton Highway, which are further north than those along the Steese and Taylor Highways, will migrate to overwintering areas sooner.\nNome Creek and the Ikhèenjik River (Birch Creek), which can be accessed from the Steese Highway, offer excellent fishing opportunities for Arctic grayling when the water is running at normal height and clear.

Despite August rain, the mainstem Yukon River is currently flowing at normal river height.\nPopular lures that fishers have reported success in capturing northern pike include buzzbait, booyah, jitterbugs, shiny spoons, and shads. Northern pike have rows of sharp teeth, so be sure to bring pliers and a spreader to safely remove hooks, especially from larger fish.\n\nSheefish\n\nSheefish spawn during late September and early October and are currently entering their spawning tributaries in the Sulukna [Nowitna], Innoko, and Alatna Rivers, and Yukon Flats. Prior to spawning, they will mill in back eddies and nearby river confluences (i.e. Porcupine River). Large, shiny and/or colorful spoons are popular lures for capturing sheefish such as crocodiles, pixies, and daredevils as well as various shads that mimic juvenile prey. Because female spawning sheefish will be gravid with thousands of eggs, please use proper catch-and-release techniques (see below) so to not cause undue stress and harm as it is important that they spawn the next generation.\n\nBurbot\n\nBurbot become more active during fall and will feed and put on weight in preparation for late January and early February spawning. Currently bait is not allowed in any of the Yukon River tributaries due to the closure of the king salmon fishery earlier this spring but can be used in the mainstem. Bait will be allowed in the Yukon River tributaries beginning on October 1, 2024. Most sport fishers target burbot with baited set lines that are fished on the bottom in slow-moving waters, often in back-eddies, and checked within 24 hours.\n\nSalmon\nKing salmon\n\nDue to poor runs, the sport fishery for king salmon will remain closed for the remainder of 2024. This closure prohibits all sport fishing for king salmon, including catch-and-release fishing. In addition, when fishing for other species, anglers may not use bait in Yukon River tributaries. The king salmon run into the lower Yukon River is complete.\n\nChum salmon\n\nThe summer chum salmon run was of sufficient size to meet spawning run goals. However, currently the fall chum salmon run is well-below average. As a result, the sport fishery for chum salmon closed on August 16. If inseason stock assessment indicates that spawning run goals and subsistence needs in the Yukon River will be met, sport fishing restrictions may be relaxed commensurate with run strength.\n\nCoho salmon\n\n\nThe coho salmon run is trending to be one of the lowest on record. As a result, the sport fishery for coho salmon closed on August 22.\n\n\nEmergency orders\n\n\nPlease review the Emergency Orders and Advisory Announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip:\n\nEmergency Order 3-KS-Y-1-2024 closes the Yukon River drainage excluding the Tanana River drainage, to sport fishing for king salmon.\nEmergency Order 3-CS-Y-17-2024 closes the Yukon River drainage excluding the Tanana River drainage, to sport fishing for chum salmon.\nEmergency Order 3-SS-Y-19-2024 closes the Yukon River drainage excluding the Tanana River drainage, to sport fishing for coho salmon.\n\nCatch-and-release techniques\n\nBecause fish typically grow and reproduce more slowly at high latitudes and elevations, please use proper catch-and-release techniques to ensure the survival of the released fish such as:\r\n\r\n\t\nUse lures with a single hook and crimp down the barb.

Due to recent snow melt and large truck traffic, drivers should be careful of large potholes and soft, muddy surfaces. Current Alaska road conditions can be found at Alaska 511.\n\nAlthough major highways may be drivable, side roads to reach the streams may not, so take care when accessing these fishing areas. Be aware for 2025 that the portion of Nome Creek Road off the Steese Highway that extends from the Nome Creek Bridge to the Ophir Creek Campground will be closed from 6 AM. to 7 PM on weekdays for road improvements and culvert replacement. During the weekends, federal holidays, and moose hunting season (September 1-15), the road will be open; however, travelers should expect traffic delays of up to 20 minutes.\n\nFreshwater Fishing\nArctic grayling\nArctic grayling are fairly ubiquitous throughout the Yukon River drainage.\n\nNome Creek is a popular Arctic grayling sport fishery that can be accessed from the Steese Highway. In lower Nome Creek and other Beaver Creek tributaries, Arctic grayling are concluding late May spawning activities and post-spawning fish will soon migrate into upper tributary summer feeding areas, which will afford good sport fishing opportunities once streams clear. NOME CREEK IS RESTRICTED TO CATCH-AND-RELEASE FISHING ONLY FOR ARCTIC GRAYLING. See Local Conditions for current access restrictions for 2025.\nBirch Creek can also be accessed from the Steese Highway is also referred to by its Gwitchin’ Athabascan name, the Ikhèenjik (Ih-hey-n-jik) River. For those planning to float Birch Creek, be aware that during 2023 a potentially hazardous new river channel was discovered a few miles downriver from the Upper Birch Creek Wayside (MP 94.1) that may require an approximately ¼ mile portage. Before visiting and/or floating from this wayside, call the Bureau of Land Management Fairbanks District office at 907-474-2200 for more information.\nStreams within the Fortymile River drainage that are accessible from the Taylor Highway will also afford good fishing opportunities once the water clears.\nDalton Highway streams are further north and are running high and turbid with melting snow and the Arctic grayling are in the midst of spawning activities. The best fishing opportunities along the Dalton Highway are during July to mid-September.\nPopular gear used to capture Arctic grayling are shiny spoons when the streams are wide enough and colorful jigs for narrower streams and creeks. Mosquitos are just beginning to appear in the upper tributaries of Nome and Beaver Creeks, Ikhèenjik River, and Taylor Highway streams, and flies mimicking these pesty blood-suckers would also be enticing to a hungry Arctic grayling that did not feed during spawning activities.\nWatch our video How to Fish for Arctic grayling to learn what you will need to know to successfully target Arctic grayling.\n\nNorthern pike\nNorthern pike are also concluding spawning activities and, like Arctic grayling, are fairly ubiquitous throughout the Yukon River drainage.\n\nGood fishing for northern pike can be found in slower moving waters like the lower portion of the Ikhèenjik River that crosses at mile 147 of the Steese Highway.\nOther popular fishing locations for large northern pike are at the mouths of major tributaries that drain into the mainstem Yukon River such as the Dall, Ray, Nowitna, and Innoko Rivers, and Hess Creek. The Yukon River is currently running high and muddy with lots of debris. Sport fishing conditions will improve for these voracious, visual predators once the water lowers and clears at the mouths of these tributaries.\nPopular lures that fishers have reported success in capturing northern pike include buzzbait, booyah, jitterbugs, shiny spoons, and shads. Northern pike have rows of sharp teeth, so be sure to bring pliers and a spreader in order to safely remove hooks, especially from larger fish.\n\nSheefish\n\nSheefish that have overwintered in the lower Yukon River are migrating upstream to summer feeding areas and as the water in the Yukon River drops and clears, good fishing opportunities can be found at the mouths of major tributaries such as the Innoko, Koyukuk, Nowitna, and Porcupine Rivers. Large, shiny spoons are popular lures for capturing sheefish such as crocodiles, pixies, and daredevils as well as various shads that mimic juvenile prey.\n\nSalmon\nKing salmon\n\nDue to a preseason projection for a below-average king salmon run in the Yukon River, the sport fishery for king salmon was closed on March 31 throughout the Yukon River drainage, including the Tanana River. This closure prohibits all sport fishing for king salmon, including catch-and-release fishing. In addition, when fishing for other species, anglers may not use bait in Yukon River tributaries.\nBecause king salmon runs in the Yukon River continue to experience historically low runs, including those crossing the border into Canada where approximately 40-50% of the salmon spawn, a 7-year agreement has been enacted to close Canadian-origin Yukon River Chinook salmon to all fishing, including subsistence, commercial, personal use, and sport fishing during 2024-2030. This agreement applies only to Canadian-origin king salmon in the mainstem Yukon River and if inseason stock assessment information indicates that king salmon escapement goals and subsistence needs will be met, sport fishing restrictions may be relaxed in Yukon River tributaries commensurate with run strengths.\n\nChum salmon\n\nFor summer chum salmon, the preseason forecast is for a run of sufficient size to meet spawning run goals. However, there is a lot of uncertainty about the 2025 run due to the low run size of the 2021 parent year. If numbers counted at the Pilot Station sonar show that the run strength will be insufficient, the sport fishery will be closed and this management action will occur quickly. So, be sure to check the Emergency Orders and Advisory Announcements before fishing for chum salmon in the Yukon River.\n\nEmergency orders\n\n\nPlease review the Emergency Orders and Advisory Announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip:\n\nEmergency Order 3-KS-Y-01-2025 closes the Yukon River drainage excluding the Tanana River drainage, to sport fishing for king salmon.\nEmergency Order 3-KS-U-02-25 closes the Tanana River drainage, which is a separate management area.\n\nCatch-and-release techniques\n\nBecause fish typically grow and reproduce more slowly at high latitudes and elevations, please use proper catch-and-release techniques to ensure the survival of the released fish such as:\r\n\r\n\t\nUse lures with a single hook and crimp down the barb. Do not use bait.\nLand the fish with a soft net and keep the fish in the water when removing the hook.\nTo release the fish, hold it gently facing into the current or in water without a current to gently cradle the fish and move it slowly back and forth until it swims away under its own power.\n\n\n\nFor More Information\nFor moe information, please call Yukon Area Management Biologist Lisa Stuby at 907-459-7202."

The Dalton Highway begins at MP 73 on the Elliott Highway. Currently road conditions for the Steese, Dalton, and Taylor Highways are rated fair, but before driving these, check the current road conditions at Alaska 511 for the latest updates. Also, be aware the first 60 miles of the Taylor Highway are paved, and the remaining sections are gravel. Recent rainfall has helped dampen down some of the fires and cleared smoke out the air. However, sunny days with forecasted thunderstorms can cause these fires to erupt again and/or create new fire activity. A good source for recent wildfire and smoke activity is at UAFSMOKE. Be careful with any fire sources when fishing and camping during hot, dry, and windy conditions.\n\nBe aware for 2025 (once fire activity subsides) that the portion of Nome Creek Road off the Steese Highway that extends from the Nome Creek Bridge to the Ophir Creek Campground will be closed from 6 AM. to 7 PM on weekdays for road improvements and culvert replacement. During the weekends, federal holidays, and moose hunting season (September 1-15), the road will be open; however, travelers should expect traffic delays of up to 20 minutes.\n\nFreshwater Fishing\nArctic grayling\n\nArctic grayling are ubiquitous throughout the Yukon River drainage. Post-spawning Arctic grayling will be at their summer feeding locations where they will remain throughout most of July and August. In general, older and larger adult Arctic grayling will occupy the upper reaches of a river or stream, gradating to smaller adults and juveniles lower in the drainages. Many of the streams accessed from the Steese, Dalton, and Taylor Highways are headwaters.\n\n\nNome Creek and the Ikhèenjik River (Birch Creek), which can be accessed from the Steese Highway, are running low and clear and offer excellent fishing opportunities for Arctic grayling. Only catch-and-release fishing for Arctic grayling is allowed in Nome Creek, which is located within the White Mountains National Recreation Area. NOME CREEK IS RESTRICTED TO CATCH-AND-RELEASE FISHING ONLY FOR ARCTIC GRAYLING.\nor those planning to float Birch Creek, be aware that during 2023 a potentially hazardous new river channel was discovered a few miles downriver from the Upper Birch Creek Wayside. Also, be aware that currently the lower Birch Creek take-out is closed due to fire activity as is the Nome Creek Road. Before beginning a float trip from the Upper to Lower Birch Creek Waysides, contact the Bureau of Land Management Fairbanks District office at 907-474-2200 for current conditions.\nStreams within the Fortymile River drainage and along the Dalton Highway, are also running clear and fishing opportunities for Arctic grayling are good.\nPopular gear used to capture Arctic grayling are shiny spoons when the streams are wide enough and colorful jigs for narrower streams and creeks. Mosquitos, mayflies, and other insects are numerous in interior Alaska and flies mimicking these would also be enticing to a hungry Arctic grayling.\nWatch our video How to Fish for Arctic grayling to learn what you will need to know to successfully target Arctic grayling.\n\nNorthern pike\nNorthern pike, like Arctic grayling, are fairly ubiquitous throughout the Yukon River drainage.\n\nGood fishing for northern pike can be found in slower moving waters like the lower portion of the Ikhèenjik River that crosses at mile 147 of the Steese Highway.\nPopular fishing locations for large northern pike are at the mouths of major tributaries that drain into the mainstem Yukon River such as the Dall, Ray, Nowitna, and Innoko Rivers, and Hess Creek. The Yukon River is currently flowing at normal river height, and the mouths of these tributaries have lowered and cleared since breakup. As a result, sport fishing has improved for these voracious, visual predators.\nPopular lures that fishers have reported success in capturing northern pike include buzzbait, booyah, jitterbugs, shiny spoons, and shads. Northern pike have rows of sharp teeth, so be sure to bring pliers and a spreader in order to safely remove hooks, especially from larger fish.\n\nSheefish\n\nSheefish continue to migrate upstream to summer feeding areas and sport fishing has improved as the Yukon River flows at normal height and the confluences of major tributaries have cleared. Good fishing opportunities can be found at the mouths of major tributaries such as the Innoko, Koyukuk, Nowitna, and Porcupine Rivers. Large, shiny spoons are popular lures for capturing sheefish such as crocodiles, pixies, and daredevils as well as various shads that mimic juvenile prey.\n\nSalmon\nKing salmon\n\nDue to a preseason projection for a below-average king salmon run in the Yukon River, the sport fishery for king salmon was closed on March 31 throughout the Yukon River drainage, including the Tanana River.

Currently, the king salmon run has passed its traditional midpoint at the Pilot Station sonar and is trending to be one of the poorest on record.\n\nChum salmon\n\nFor summer chum salmon, the preseason forecast is for a run of sufficient size to meet spawning run goals. However, there is a lot of uncertainty about the 2025 run due to the low run size of the 2021 parent year. Counts at the Pilot Station sonar have been low; however, recently large pulses have been seen. Therefore, the sport fishery remains open pending more information. The pre-season projection for fall chum salmon, which typically appear in the lower Yukon River during mid-July, is for a poor run that will not meet spawning escapement goals. So, before fishing for chum salmon in the Yukon River, be sure to check the Emergency Orders and Advisory Announcements because if it looks as though the chum salmon runs will not meet spawning escapement goals, the sport fishery will be closed.\n\nEmergency orders\n\n\nPlease review the Emergency Orders and Advisory Announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip:\n\nEmergency Order 3-KS-Y-01-2025 closes the Yukon River drainage excluding the Tanana River drainage, to sport fishing for king salmon.\n\nCatch-and-release techniques\n\nBecause fish typically grow and reproduce more slowly at high latitudes and elevations, please use proper catch-and-release techniques to ensure the survival of the released fish such as:\r\n\r\n\t\nUse lures with a single hook and crimp down the barb.

An announcement will be issued on May 29 with more details about when the fishery will open.\nThe Miles Lake sonar is up and running, but only on one bank and only for several hours each day. Miles Lake remains frozen and the sonar must be continuously manned to ensure it isn’t damaged by ice. No fish have been counted past the sonar yet.\nWater levels at the sonar site are at historic lows and water temperature is only 1 degree Celsius. Water flow in Chitina is also historically low with a lot of exposed gravel bars and blowing dust.\nInformation hotline for Chitina personal use fishery: 907-822-3309\n\nSport Fishing\n\nSince so few salmon have been counted at the Miles Lake sonar and sampling fish wheels above Miles Lake have captured no salmon to date it is unlikely any salmon have entered the Gulkana or Klutina Rivers.\nNow is a good time to target Arctic grayling in the Gulkana River and all the small streams crossing our highways. For an adventure try heading out the Klutina Lake Road to just below the lake and target those big Dolly Varden and the occasional wandering rainbow trout.\nTwo and Three-Mile Lakes in Chitina have received their first loads of catchable rainbow trout and Arctic Char.

Lake Louise is about a week away from being ice free.\nThe Copper River flow gauge in Chitina is back online. You can view this yourself at the NOAA website. The latest gauge reading as of May 30 was 12.2 feet, which is the 5th lowest reading for this date since we have records for (2005)\n\nChitina Personal Use Fishery\n\nThe first opening of the Chitina Subdistrict personal use salmon dipnet fishery has been delayed until sometime during the week of June 10. Sonar passage from this past Monday through Sunday, June 2nd will determine the actual opening date. Unless salmon passage at the sonar dramatically increases the opening will not occur until later in that week.\nThe Miles Lake sonar is now fully operational with both North and South banks up and running.\nAs of May 28, a total of 16,721 salmon have been counted at the sonar. The anticipated sonar passage through 5/28 is 98,770 salmon. Daily passage of salmon at the sonar is currently 1/3 of the expected daily counts. The low counts are likely due to river conditions delaying the arrival of salmon to the Copper River.\nAccess between O’Brien Creek and Haley Creek: ADOT has completed one bridge over a suspected grave site and is working on a second one. All work should be completed before the fishery opens. However, if a land slide occurs this summer, it is doubtful ADOT will be able to move equipment down the ROW to clear it.\nInformation hotline for Chitina personal use fishery: 907-822-3309\n\nGlennallen Subdistrict Subsistence Fishery\n\nThe Glennallen Subdistrict subsistence salmon fishery opens on June 1 by regulation.

If you got a paper permit at a vendor or an ADF&G office, you may still report your harvest online, but you will have to enter your name, address, and sport fish license number.\nYou may also log and report your personal use harvest through the ADF&G mobile app. If you take this route, make sure you open the app when you have service for your logged harvest to upload to the reporting database.\n\nSport Fishing\n\nLake trout and burbot may be found in shallower waters as the lakes cool. Lake Louise and Susitna Lake and Paxson and Summit Lakes on the Richardson Highway are all good choices for these species.\nArctic grayling: Try fishing some smaller lakes and their outlets or closer to shore in larger lakes. If stream fishing, try upper stream sections where the water is coldest to find bigger fish. Paxson Lake near the BLM campground is usually a productive spot for Arctic grayling. Be sure to watch the How to Fish for Arctic Grayling video on the ADF&G Youtube channel for helpful tips.\nDolly Varden: The Little Tonsina River and the upper Klutina River are always a good choice for Dollies. Also fish along the Nabesna and McCarthy Roads. For smaller Dollies you can have a great time fishing the Tiekel River, which runs along Richardson Highway on the way to Valdez.\nFor information about stocked lakes in the Upper Copper River drainage visit the Alaska Lake Database.\nFor a guide to local area small fisheries, check out Sport fishing Alaska rivers and lakes in the Upper Copper/Upper Susitna River Basin. This guide lists all the fisheries, species available and mile markers along all the major highways crossing the Upper Copper and Upper Susitna Area.\n\nSalmon\n\nSockeye salmon: Sockeye are still moving into the Klutina River, providing an excellent opportunity for salmon fishing. You can also try fishing the Tonsina River near the Squirrel Creek Campground. If you've never fished the Klutina River before, watch the How to Fish for Klutina River Red Salmon video on the ADF&G Youtube channel. Sockeye salmon are between runs on the Gulkana River but look to this river for great sockeye fishing in mid-August through mid-September.\nKing salmon: ALL WATERS of the Upper Copper River drainage are closed to king salmon fishing. King salmon may not be targeted and must be released immediately if incidentally caught. Additionally, all flowing water in the Upper Copper River drainage are restricted to no bait, single hook artificial lures.\n\nEmergency Orders\n\nEmergency Order 3-KS-I-9-24 closes the Upper Copper River drainage upstream of the south bank of Haley Creek to all sport fishing for king salmon, including catch-and-release fishing. All king salmon incidentally caught while fishing for other species may not be removed from the water and must be released immediately. In addition, the use of bait is still prohibited and anglers may only use unbaited, single-hook, artificial lures in all flowing waters of the Upper Copper River drainage through 11:59 p.m. Saturday, August 10.\nEmergency Order 3-KS-I-10-24 closes the Glennallen Subdistrict subsistence salmon fishery to the retention of king salmon. Any king salmon incidentally taken may not be retained and must be released immediately. Fish wheels must be closely attended while spinning and any kings caught must be released immediately, even if the fish wheel is equipped with a live box.\nEmergency Order 3-KS-I-15-24 amends the schedule for the Chitina Subdistrict personal use dip net salmon fishery for the week of July 22 – 28, 2024.

Retention of king salmon is prohibited during this period.\n\nADF&G News\n\nFish remains attract bears — Remember to Stop, chop and throw.\n\nWhen possible, clean fish at a designated fish cleaning station, or at home.\nCut filleted fish carcasses into smaller pieces that can be easily carried away in the current.\nToss all fish waste into deep, fast-moving currents — not in dumpsters! Do not leave entrails or other fish waste on the bank or in shallow water.\nIf you clean your fish at home, place entrails and fish waste into the freezer until the morning of garbage day. Do not leave fish waste outside in garbage cans for multiple days, as bears will be attracted to the smell, even in town. A benefit of filleting at home is that it yields cleaner meat than filleting in the field.\nFor more information on how to live, travel, hunt and fish in bear country (most of Alaska), visit the State Parks website Bears and You.\n\n\nDon't forget to purchase your 2024 sport fishing license and king stamp.

For information on access across private lands contact Chitina Native Corporation at (907) 823-2223 or Ahtna, Inc. at (907) 822-3476.\nDetailed information about this fishery can be found on the Chitina Personal Use Salmon Fishery web page of the ADF&G website.\nInformation hotline for Chitina personal use fishery: 907-822-5224.\nIf you haven't participated in this fishery before, be sure to watch the 4-part video series How to Dipnet for Salmon at Chitina on the ADF&G website or on the ADF&G Youtube channel.\n\nGlennallen Subdistrict Subsistence Fishery\n\nThe Glennallen Subdistrict subsistence salmon fishery is currently open and will remain open through September 30th.\n\nOnline Harvest Reporting\n\nHarvest information must be reported online. If you got your permit online, the system will recognize you once you enter your permit number. If you got a paper permit at a vendor or an ADF&G office, you may still report your harvest online, but you will have to enter your name, address, and sport fish license number.\nYou may also log and report your personal use harvest through the ADF&G mobile app. If you take this route, make sure you open the app when you have service for your logged harvest to upload to the reporting database.\nPlease note, if you used the ADF&G mobile app to record your Chitina Personal Use Dipnet Permit harvest but are still receiving this reminder to report, please open the app while in phone service to transmit your records to the department. Any harvest recorded on the app while out of cell service were not automatically transmitted to the department. Simply reopen/launch the app once back in cell service and all logged harvest records will be automatically transmitted.\n\nSport Fishing\n\nLake trout and burbot: Lake Trout are moving into spawning areas in local lakes. Expect good fishing out to about 20 feet of water. Burbot are starting to spread out from deeper waters and should be feeding heavily.\nArctic grayling: These fish are on the move and good fishing can be had nearly anywhere. Now is the time to hit the main stem Gulkana for good sized fish.\nDolly Varden: The Little Tonsina River and the upper Klutina River are always a good choice for Dollies. Also try along the Nabesna and McCarthy Roads, the fish may be a bit smaller, but they are more plentiful. For even smaller Dollies try fishing the Tiekel River which runs along Richardson Highway on the way to Valdez.\nSeveral popular lakes recently received a new batch of stocked rainbow trout. Lakes that were recently stocked include Tex Smith Lake, Pippin Lake, Two Mile Lake, Old Road Lake and Round Lake. For information about stocked lakes in the Upper Copper River drainage visit the Alaska Lake Database.\nFor a guide to local area small fisheries, check out Sport fishing Alaska rivers and lakes in the Upper Copper/Upper Susitna River Basin. This guide lists all the fisheries, species available and mile markers along all the major highways crossing the Upper Copper and Upper Susitna Area.\nWhen releasing fish, practice proper catch-and-release techniques to promote sustainable fisheries and helps ensure Alaska's fishing legacy remains healthy and intact well into the future. It's truly up to the angler to choose to be a steward of the resources that comprise Alaska's unique natural world.\n\nSalmon\n\nSockeye salmon: The Gulkana River is the place to go for sockeyes. Target Sourdough Camnpground and above. Most of the late Gulkana River run has moved through the lower river reaches.\n\nEmergency Orders\n\nThere are currently no EO’s in effect in the UCUSMA.\n\nADF&G News\n\nYou can purchase licenses through the ADF&G online store and print it off from the comfort of your own home. Make sure to review emergency orders, advisory announcements, and the 2024 Northern Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary Booklet for the area you are fishing before you head out.\nThe Glennallen ADF&G office has fishing rods to loan out as part of the ADF&G Rod Loaner Program. All you need is a current sport fishing license (for resident anglers 18 and older and non-residents 16 or older) to borrow a rod. You’ll have to provide your own tackle but rods are free of charge.\nBe sure to check out the ADF&G Youtube channel for a wide variety of how-to videos, as well as videos that highlight the research projects undertaken by the Alaska Department of Fish & Game.\n\nFor additional information, please contact the ADF&G Glennallen office at (907) 822-3309."

Sport anglers are only allowed to retain 1 king salmon this season from any of the tributaries open to king salmon sport fishing.\nSockeye salmon fishing on the Klutina River has slowed down as of this past weekend. While sockeye continue to enter that system, radiotelemetry data show they are not entering in the numbers they were a week ago. The river is also running very high from the recent hot weather, making fishing difficult, but water level is anticipated to drop over the next several days.\nBe sure to watch the ADF&G video, \"How to Fish for Klutina River Red Salmon\" for helpful tips on fishing strategy, access points and camping options.\n\nEmergency Orders\n\nEmergency Order 3-RS-1-10-25 opens the Chitina Subdistrict personal use dip net salmon fishery for a 168-hour period from 12:01am Monday, June 30 through 11:59 pm Sunday, July 6 and closes the fishery to the retention of king salmon for the remainder of the season.\nEmergency Order 3-KS-1-09-25 reduces the king salmon annual limit from 4 to 1 fish and prohibits the use of bait and treble hooks in the Gulkana River drainage. King salmon harvested from the Upper Copper River drainage prior to June 20 does not count toward the newly reduce 1 fish annual limit.\n\nADF&G News\n\nThe Glennallen ADF&G office has fishing rods to loan out as part of the ADF&G Rod Loaner Program. All you need is a current sport fishing license (for resident anglers 18 and older and non-residents 16 or older) to borrow a rod.

Warmer weather should result in more snowmelt at high elevations, which could push water levels up.\nMost of the river boat launches are ice-free, although some remain soft and muddy. The George Lake boat launch on the Tanana River south of Delta Junction is too soft for launching boats and there is not adequate water to launch a boat. It may be a bit before the ramp is usable and people can access the lake through this route.\n\nFreshwater species\nArctic grayling\n\nArctic grayling have completed spawning in most rivers and should be migrating to their summer feeding grounds. Anglers are already having success catching grayling in the upper Chena River near Fairbanks and the Delta Clearwater River in Delta Junction, a sign that grayling are available in their summer habitats. Fishing should only get better as the weather warms and insects begin to emerge.\n\nNorthern pike\n\nNorthern pike fishing in the Tolovana River drainage, including Minto Flats, Minto Lakes and the Chatanika River, remains closed until June 1 to protect spawning northern pike. The bag and possession limit for northern pike in those waters when the fishery does open has been reduced from 5 fish a day to 2 fish a day, only one of which may be 30 inches or longer.\nNorthern pike fishing in waters that are open to fishing can be productive at this time of year. Try big, flashy spoons to attract their attention.\n\nBurbot\n\nBurbot fishing downstream from the mouths of tributaries in the Tanana is great this time of year. Try fishing bait (herring, whitefish) on the bottom of the river in back eddy areas and slow-moving waters in the mainstem of the Tanana River. Remember, bait is prohibited in tributaries of the Tanana River but not in the mainstem of the river.\n\nStocked lakes\n\nStaff at Ruth Burnett Sport Fish Hatchery in Fairbanks have been busy stocking catchable-size Arctic char and rainbow trout into local lakes and ponds for the past two weeks. To date, hatchery staff have stocked more than 35,000 catchable-size (9-10 inches) Arctic char and rainbow trout into 19 lakes in the Tanana River drainage. More than 5,000 rainbow trout were stocked in Quartz Lake this week and almost 3,000 rainbows were put in Birch Lake. Fish stocking will continue through this week and next.\nTry fishing small pieces of shrimp or salmon eggs under a bobber or use small, flashy spoons or spinners to entice fish to bite.\nFor a complete list of stocked lakes in the Interior and statewide, check out the Alaska Lake Database to see when lakes were stocked, how many fish were stocked and what kind of fish were stocked.\n\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the Emergency Orders and Advisory Announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip:\n\nEmergency Order 3-KS-U-4-24 closes sport fishing for king salmon in all flowing waters of the Tanana River drainage. King salmon may not be targeted and those caught incidentally while fishing for other species may not be removed from the water and must be released immediately. In addition, the use of bait is prohibited in all Tanana River tributaries.\nEmergency Order 3-NP-U-5-24 reduces the bag and possession limit for northern pike in all lakes and flowing waters of the Minto Flats area to two fish, only one of which may be 30 inches or greater in length.

The clearwater rivers may be better fishing if the other rivers become high and murky due to snowmelt.\nFrom June 1 through March 31, the lower Chena River downstream of the Chena River Dam (located at Chena Lake Recreation Area) has a bag and possession limit of 1 fish any size.\nThis weekend marks the first of four consecutive weekends for a special youth fishery in the lower Chena River below the Chena River Flood Control Project. Only anglers who are 15 years of age or younger may fish for and retain 1 Arctic grayling of any size per day on the following dates: June 21-22, June 28-29, July 5-6, July 12-13.\nTry using small spinners (sizes 0-2) and spoons (1/4 to 1/2 oz) if using a spinning rod and small dry flies (sizes 10-16) like caddis, mayflies, midges, mosquitoes, wooly buggers, gnats, etc. for fly fishing.\nCheck out the ADF&G “How To Fish For Arctic Grayling” video to learn the ins and outs of Arctic grayling fishing.\n\nNorthern pike\n\nNorthern pike fishing could be a challenge with the hot temperatues as fish tend to be more lethargic and seek deeper water. Try big, flashy spoons and top-water lures in shaded areas to attract their attention.\nNorthern pike fishing in the Tolovana River drainage, including Minto Flats, Minto Lakes and the Chatanika River, opened June 1. The bag and possession limit for northern pike has been reduced by emergency order from 5 fish a day to 2 fish a day, only one of which may be 30 inches or longer.\n\nBurbot\n\nBurbot fishing downstream from the mouths of tributaries in the Tanana can be good this time of year; however, as the Tanana rises, fishing will become more difficult. Try fishing bait (herring, whitefish) on the bottom of the river in back eddy areas and slow-moving waters in the mainstem of the Tanana River. Remember, the emergency order for king salmon restricts the use of bait in tributaries of the Tanana River but not in the mainstem of the river.\nIf you get lucky and land a burbot, watch the ADF&G \"How to Clean a Burbot\" video for a quick tutorial on how to fillet your fish.\n\nStocked lakes\n\nNearly all stocking has been completed at area lakes.\nTry fishing small pieces of shrimp or salmon eggs under a bobber or use small, flashy spoons or spinners to entice fish to bite.\nFor a complete list of stocked lakes in the Interior and statewide, check out the Alaska Lake Database to see when lakes were stocked, how many fish were stocked and what kind of fish were stocked.\nYou can also use the Fish Stocking Search Tool on the ADF&G website for a more detailed search of current stocking information.\nGo the ADF&G website to check out the Tanana River Drainage Stocked Lakes Fishing Guide that has information on all stocked lakes in the Tanana River drainage or pick up a copy at ADF&G offices in Fairbanks and Delta Junction.\nTo increase your chances of catching stocked fish, use small hooks. If you're using bait, a size 10 to 12 hook baited with a single salmon egg or a tiny nib of shrimp works well. If you plan to use a lure, a small size 1 spinner or spoon will get you the most action.\n\nEmergency Orders\n\nEmergency Order 3-KS-U-02-25 closes sport fishing for king salmon in all flowing waters of the Tanana River drainage due to a preseason forecast for a below-average Yukon River king salmon run. This closure prohibits all sport fishing for king salmon, including catch-and-release fishing, in all waters of the Tanana River drainage, including the Chena, Goodpaster and Salcha Rivers. In addition, the use of bait is prohibited in all Tanana River tributaries (i.e. rivers and streams) when fishing for other species. Only unbaited, artificial lures may be used. All king salmon caught incidentally while fishing for other species may not be removed from the water and must be released immediately.\nEmergency Order 3-NP-U-05-25 reduces the bag and possession limit for northern pike in all lakes and flowing waters of the Minto Flats area, including the Chatanika and Tolovana River drainages and Minto Lakes, from five to two fish, only one of which may be 30 inches or longer, from June 1 – October 14, 2025.\n\nADF&G News\n\nBoth the Delta and Fairbanks offices have fishing rods to loan out as part of the ADF&G Rod Loaner Program. All you need is a current sport fishing license (for resident anglers 18 and older and non-residents 16 or older) to borrow a rod. You’ll have to provide your own tackle but rods are free of charge.\nCheck out ADF&G’s public use cabin reservation system to see about renting a free public use cabin on one of six different fishing lakes in the Delta Junction area.\nThe Tanana Valley Fisheries Center in the Ruth Burnett Sport Fish Hatchery at 1150 Wilbur Street in Fairbanks is open to the public Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Stop in to say hi and see what’s growing in the hatchery.\nBe sure to follow the ADFG Sport Fishing Interior Alaska Facebook page or ADFG Sport Fishing Interior Alaska Instagram page for the most up-to-date information about fishing in Interior Alaska.

Download the ADF&G Mobile App today.\nFreshwater Fishing\nArctic grayling\n\n\nFishing for Arctic grayling has been good in streams throughout Norton Sound. Small spinners as well as smolt imitations and dry flies will work well. Soon, egg-imitation lures and flies will become productive as salmon spawning commences. in rivers. North Slope rivers are running low and clear in most places and fishing for Arctic grayling should be good. Grayling fishing in North Slope lakes has also been productive.\n\n\nNorthern pike\n\n\nFishing for northern pike has been great as the water levels have dropped and fish have moved into off-channel habitats of the Pilgrim, Kuzitrin, Selawik, and Kobuk Rivers. Big spoons and soft baits work well for northern pike, as do large topwater lures and flies.\n\n\nArctic char and lake trout\n\n\nFishing for Arctic char and lake trout in North Slope lakes has been good but the lake trout and Arctic char will move into deeper water as the temperatures rise during mid-day. Fishing effort for burbot has historically been low in the Northwest and the North Slope Management Areas (NW/NSMA) but large fish can be found in many North Slope rivers and lakes. These are almost exclusively caught with cut bait fished on the bottom.\n\n\nSalmon\n\nCounting projects for salmon in Norton Sound are up and running. King salmon are not projected to meet the escapement goal on the North River, and king salmon fishing throughout southern Norton Sound was closed by emergency order on June 23.\nPink salmon runs have been larger than average, and the daily bag and possession limit for pink salmon was increased by emergency order from 10 to 20 fish on July 14.\nChum salmon runs have been good in Northern Norton Sound, and escapement goals have already been met in the Snake, Eldorado, and Kwiniuk Rivers. Counts of chum salmon in the Unalakleet River drainage have been well below average.\n\nSheefish\n\n\nSheefish have begun their upstream migration to spawning grounds in the Kobuk and Selawik Rivers, and fish have been caught near the Kobuk River villages of Selawik and Kobuk. Spawning generally occurs in late-September, just before freeze-up.\n\n\nDolly Varden\n\n\nSpawning runs of Dolly Varden have begun upstream migration in Northwestern and North Slope rivers, and fish will trickle in through August. The Noatak and Wulik Rivers are the most popular spots for large Dolly Varden, with fish over 12 pounds possible in both drainages.\n\n\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the Emergency Orders and Advisory Announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip:\n\nEmergency Order 3-KS-W-06-22 closes sport fishing for king salmon in all freshwaters from Bald Head to Point Romanof. This closure includes, but is not limited to, the Unalakleet, Shaktoolik, Koyuk, Ungalik, Inglutalik, and Golsovia river drainages. In addition, only one unbaited, single-hook, artificial lure may be used in these drainages. All king salmon caught incidentally in the waters described above while fishing for other species may not be removed from the water and must be released immediately.\nEmergency Order 3-PS-W-19-22 increases the sport fish bag and possession limit for pink salmon from 10 to 20 fish in Norton Sound, which includes all flowing waters draining into Norton Sound from Cape Prince of Wales to Point Romanof. In the Unalakleet River drainage, the bag and possession limit for salmon, other than king salmon, is 20 fish, of which only four fish, in combination, may be coho, chum, and sockeye salmon.\n\nAdditional Tips\n\nBecause fish typically grow and reproduce more slowly at high latitudes and elevations, please use proper techniques when engaging in catch-and-release in order to ensure the survival of the released fish such as:\r\n\r\n\t\nUse lures with a single hook and crimp down the barb. Do not use bait.\nLand the fish with a soft net and keep the fish in the water when removing the hook.\nTo release the fish, hold it gently facing into the current or in water without a current gently cradle the fish and move it slowly back and forth until it swims away under its own power.\n\n\nDon’t forget to bring your 2022 sport fishing license. Help maximize social distancing by purchasing your sport fishing license at the ADF&G Online Store and printing it off from the comfort of your home. Also, be sure to review Emergency Orders and the 2022 Northern Sport Fishing Regulations Summary Booklet for the area you are fishing in before you head out.\n\nFor More Information\nCall Northwest and North Slope Area Management Biologist Brendan Scanlon at (907) 459-7268."

Conversely, a late-season snowstorm followed by hot weather on the North Slope brought rivers up above flood stage, and most North Slope rivers are still too high for safe fishing or boating. Most lakes in the Norton Sound and Kotzebue areas are open, while most North Slope lakes are ice covered with open leads around the perimeter.\nSport Fishing\nResident Species\n\nFishing for Arctic grayling and Dolly Varden has been very good in Norton Sound streams. Smolt imitation flies work best, but small jigs and spoons can work, too. Fishing for Dollies has been particularly good on the Sinuk, Pilgrim, Nome, and Unalakleet Rivers. Fishing with dry flies on the Niukluk and Fish Rivers has been excellent for grayling. It will be a week or two before river conditions in North Slope drainages are suitable for fishing.\nMost Dolly Varden have moved out of their overwintering areas in the Wulik, Noatak, and Kivalina Rivers on their way to marine feeding areas, or back to their natal streams to spawn. Fishing in rivers will pick up after July 1 and will stay good through September.\nFishing for Arctic char, lake trout, and Arctic grayling in North Slope lakes can be good in the open leads along the shore while the water is still cold, but the lake trout and Arctic char will move into deeper water as the temperatures rise later in the summer.\nNorthern pike are done spawning and should be nice and hungry. The Kuzitrin and Pilgrim Rivers near Nome are good spots, as are the many sloughs and off-channel oxbow lakes of the larger Kobuk, Selawik, and Noatak Rivers.\nSheefish begin their upstream migration to the spawning grounds in the Kobuk and Selawik Rivers around July 1, and fish can be caught near the Kobuk River villages of Noorvik and Kiana about a week later. One angler caught a 40 pound sheefish at the outlet of the Kobuk River downstream of Noorvik last week.\n\nAnadromous Species\n\nSalmon counting projects are up and operational on the Niukluk, Unalakleet, Nome, and Snake Rivers, however, no salmon have been counted so far. Both king and chum salmon have been seen in the nearshore marine waters of southern Norton Sound so it should be any day now.\n\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the Emergency Orders and Advisory Announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip:\n\nEmergency Order 3-KS-W-04-25 Closes sport fishing for king salmon in all fresh waters from Bald Head to Point Romanof. This closure includes, but is not limited to, the Unalakleet, Shaktoolik, Koyuk, Ungalik, Inglutalik, and Golsovia river drainages. In addition, only one unbaited, single-hook, artificial lure may be used in these drainages. All king salmon caught incidentally in the waters described above while fishing for other species may not be removed from the water and must be released immediately.\n\n\n\nAdditional Tips\n\nBecause fish typically grow and reproduce more slowly at high latitudes and elevations, please use proper catch-and-release techniques when engaging in catch-and-release fishing in order to ensure the survival of the released fish such as:\r\n\r\n\t\nUse lures with a single hook and crimp down the barb. Do not use bait.\nLand the fish with a soft net and keep the fish in the water when removing the hook.\nTo release the fish, hold it gently facing into the current or in water without a current gently cradle the fish and move it slowly back and forth until it swims away under its own power.\n\n\n\nADF&G News\nYou also purchase licenses through the ADF&G online store and print it off at home. Make sure to review emergency orders, advisory announcements, and the 2025 Northern Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary Booklet for the area you are fishing before you head out.\nFor More Information\nCall Northwest and North Slope Area Management Biologist Brendan Scanlon at (907) 459-7268."

Catches of king salmon in the Kanektok and Goodnews Rivers are reported to be good.\nThe Kuskokwim Bay rivers (Kanektok, Goodnews, Arolik) may be a good alternative to king fishing on the Kuskokwim river tributaries. The Kuskokwim Bay tributaries remain open at this time – but please check for any announcements prior to making plans.\nThe US Fish and Wildlife Service (Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge) has closed the harvest of king, chum and coho salmon to people that are not residents of the Kuskokwim River (but not currently the Kuskokwim Bay Rivers). Please contact their office in Bethel at (907) 543-3151 for more information.\nSheefish\nSheefish are catchable at the mouths of many clearwater rivers such as the Aniak and Holitna Rivers, as well as other clearwater streams near Bethel such as the Kwethluk and Kisaralik Rivers. Large colorful spoons and spinners work well for these. Initially, high water levels have given way to more average levels and clarity which has contributed to better catchability.\nRainbow Trout\nRainbow trout catches are currently reported as fair in both the sport fisheries and the subsistence rod-and-reel fisheries. These popular fisheries occur in the Kuskokwim Bay Rivers - Goodnews, Kanektok, and Arolik, and in the lower Kuskokwim drainages that include the Kisaralik, Kwethluk, Kasigluk, and Aniak Rivers. These are popular guided and outfitted fisheries in remote Alaska, with many private businesses that provide excellent services and opportunities.\nDolly Varden\nDolly Varden catches have been reported to be spotty to poor in many Kuskokwim River tributaries.\nNorthern Pike\nNorthern pike fishing has been excellent with increasing water clarity as the high water conditions have decreased. Any clearwater mouth or connected slough complex along the mainstem Kuskokwim River affords excellent fishing. Anything that imitates prey and attracts attention will work. Crocodiles and larges spoons work anytime, and topwater lures such as jitterbugs and large fly patterns work best in late evening under the midnight sun when the large pike will lurk in the warm surface waters.\nEmergency Orders\nPlease review the Emergency Orders and Advisory Announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip:\n\nEmergency Order 3-KS-V-03-25 closes the Kuskokwim River drainage to sport fishing for king salmon.\n\nBest Practices\nDuring these times of salmon conservation, it is important to use best practices when handling fish, especially if a fish is accidentally caught that is in a closed fishery. These practices include:\n\nKeeping the fish in the water\nUsing single-hook lures or flies\nWhen taking pictures, cradle the fish with both hands\nPinching your barbs down\nIf you cannot remove the fly easily, consider cutting the line or the hook\n\nEnjoy these western Alaska fishing opportunities, operate boats in courteous manner, pack out your waste and only leave your footprints. Good luck fishing!\nADF&G News\nDon’t forget to bring your 2025 sport fishing license. You may purchase your sport fishing license online at the ADF&G Online Store. Also, be sure to review Emergency Orders and the 2025 Northern Sport Fishing Regulations Summary Booklet for the area you are fishing before you head out.\nFor more information, please call Kuskokwim-Goodnews Area Manager John Chythlook at (907) 459-7361."

The Dalton Highway begins at MP 73 on the Elliott Highway. Currently road conditions for the Steese, Dalton, and Taylor Highways are rated fair, but before driving these, check the current road conditions at Alaska 511 for the latest updates. Also, be aware the first 60 miles of the Taylor Highway are paved, and the remaining sections are gravel. Recent rainfall has helped dampen down some of the fires and cleared smoke out the air. However, sunny days with forecasted thunderstorms can cause these fires to erupt again and/or create new fire activity. A good source for recent wildfire and smoke activity is at UAFSMOKE. Be careful with any fire sources when fishing and camping during hot, dry, and windy conditions.\n\nBe aware for 2025 (once fire activity subsides) that the portion of Nome Creek Road off the Steese Highway that extends from the Nome Creek Bridge to the Ophir Creek Campground will be closed from 6 AM. to 7 PM on weekdays for road improvements and culvert replacement. During the weekends, federal holidays, and moose hunting season (September 1-15), the road will be open; however, travelers should expect traffic delays of up to 20 minutes.\n\nFreshwater Fishing\nArctic grayling\n\nArctic grayling are ubiquitous throughout the Yukon River drainage. Post-spawning Arctic grayling will be at their summer feeding locations where they will remain throughout most of July and August. In general, older and larger adult Arctic grayling will occupy the upper reaches of a river or stream, gradating to smaller adults and juveniles lower in the drainages. Many of the streams accessed from the Steese, Dalton, and Taylor Highways are headwaters.\n\n\nNome Creek and the Ikhèenjik River (Birch Creek), which can be accessed from the Steese Highway, are running low and clear and offer excellent fishing opportunities for Arctic grayling. Only catch-and-release fishing for Arctic grayling is allowed in Nome Creek, which is located within the White Mountains National Recreation Area. NOME CREEK IS RESTRICTED TO CATCH-AND-RELEASE FISHING ONLY FOR ARCTIC GRAYLING.\nor those planning to float Birch Creek, be aware that during 2023 a potentially hazardous new river channel was discovered a few miles downriver from the Upper Birch Creek Wayside. Also, be aware that currently the lower Birch Creek take-out is closed due to fire activity as is the Nome Creek Road. Before beginning a float trip from the Upper to Lower Birch Creek Waysides, contact the Bureau of Land Management Fairbanks District office at 907-474-2200 for current conditions.\nStreams within the Fortymile River drainage and along the Dalton Highway, are also running clear and fishing opportunities for Arctic grayling are good.\nPopular gear used to capture Arctic grayling are shiny spoons when the streams are wide enough and colorful jigs for narrower streams and creeks. Mosquitos, mayflies, and other insects are numerous in interior Alaska and flies mimicking these would also be enticing to a hungry Arctic grayling.\nWatch our video How to Fish for Arctic grayling to learn what you will need to know to successfully target Arctic grayling.\n\nNorthern pike\nNorthern pike, like Arctic grayling, are fairly ubiquitous throughout the Yukon River drainage.\n\nGood fishing for northern pike can be found in slower moving waters like the lower portion of the Ikhèenjik River that crosses at mile 147 of the Steese Highway.\nPopular fishing locations for large northern pike are at the mouths of major tributaries that drain into the mainstem Yukon River such as the Dall, Ray, Nowitna, and Innoko Rivers, and Hess Creek. The Yukon River is currently flowing at normal river height, and the mouths of these tributaries have lowered and cleared since breakup. As a result, sport fishing has improved for these voracious, visual predators.\nPopular lures that fishers have reported success in capturing northern pike include buzzbait, booyah, jitterbugs, shiny spoons, and shads. Northern pike have rows of sharp teeth, so be sure to bring pliers and a spreader in order to safely remove hooks, especially from larger fish.\n\nSheefish\n\nSheefish continue to migrate upstream to summer feeding areas and sport fishing has improved as the Yukon River flows at normal height and the confluences of major tributaries have cleared. Good fishing opportunities can be found at the mouths of major tributaries such as the Innoko, Koyukuk, Nowitna, and Porcupine Rivers. Large, shiny spoons are popular lures for capturing sheefish such as crocodiles, pixies, and daredevils as well as various shads that mimic juvenile prey.\n\nSalmon\nKing salmon\n\nDue to a preseason projection for a below-average king salmon run in the Yukon River, the sport fishery for king salmon was closed on March 31 throughout the Yukon River drainage, including the Tanana River. This closure prohibits all sport fishing for king salmon, including catch-and-release fishing. In addition, when fishing for other species, anglers may not use bait in Yukon River tributaries.\nBecause king salmon runs in the Yukon River continue to experience historically low runs, including those crossing the border into Canada where approximately 40-50% of the salmon spawn, a 7-year agreement has been enacted to close Canadian-origin Yukon River Chinook salmon to all fishing, including subsistence, commercial, personal use, and sport fishing during 2024-2030. Currently, the king salmon run has passed its traditional midpoint at the Pilot Station sonar and is trending to be one of the poorest on record.\n\nChum salmon\n\nFor summer chum salmon, the preseason forecast is for a run of sufficient size to meet spawning run goals. However, there is a lot of uncertainty about the 2025 run due to the low run size of the 2021 parent year. Counts at the Pilot Station sonar have been low; however, recently large pulses have been seen. Therefore, the sport fishery remains open pending more information. The pre-season projection for fall chum salmon, which typically appear in the lower Yukon River during mid-July, is for a poor run that will not meet spawning escapement goals. So, before fishing for chum salmon in the Yukon River, be sure to check the Emergency Orders and Advisory Announcements because if it looks as though the chum salmon runs will not meet spawning escapement goals, the sport fishery will be closed.\n\nEmergency orders\n\n\nPlease review the Emergency Orders and Advisory Announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip:\n\nEmergency Order 3-KS-Y-01-2025 closes the Yukon River drainage excluding the Tanana River drainage, to sport fishing for king salmon.\n\nCatch-and-release techniques\n\nBecause fish typically grow and reproduce more slowly at high latitudes and elevations, please use proper catch-and-release techniques to ensure the survival of the released fish such as:\r\n\r\n\t\nUse lures with a single hook and crimp down the barb. Do not use bait.\nLand the fish with a soft net and keep the fish in the water when removing the hook.\nTo release the fish, hold it gently facing into the current or in water without a current to gently cradle the fish and move it slowly back and forth until it swims away under its own power.\n\n\n\nADF&G News\nYou can purchase your fishing license through the ADF&G Online Storee. Also, before heading out, be sure to review the Emergency Orders and the 2025 Northern Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary Booklet for the area you are fishing.\nFor More Information\nFor moe information, please call Yukon Area Management Biologist Lisa Stuby at 907-459-7202."

The water did drop on 9 June to the low end of the range for the last week.You can view the Copper River’s stage gauge in Chitina online at this NOAA website.\nWeather during the 4th of July weekend was sunny and warm but not hot. Since that time, a low pressure system has brought widespread cloud cover with scattered rain showers resulting in minimal precipitation at lower elevations while higher elevations receive more snowfall. Small incremental breaks in the cloud cover this week should provide welcome glimpses of sunshine and a slight uptick in daytime temperatures into the high 60s and low 70s, as the cloud cover and scattered rain showers continue to dominate our Copper River Valley weather.\nVery minimal rainfall in the Gulkana River drainage recently has had no discernable effect on water level and it remains relatively clear.\n\nChitina Subdistrict Personal Use Dip Net Fishery\n\nThe Chitina Subdistrict personal use salmon dipnet fishery will open at 12 pm (noon) on Thursday, July 10 and remain open through midnight on Sunday, July 20.\nDuring June 30–July 6, there 114,098 salmon counted past the Miles Lake sonar. The preseason projection for this period was 59,101 salmon, which results in a surplus of 54,997 salmon.\nThrough July 8, the cumulative count of salmon past Miles Lake sonar is 700,269. This count is approximately 210,000 fish greater than the expected cumulative count for this date. The rule of thumb is that it takes approximately 10-14 days for salmon to reach the dip net fishery from Miles Lake sonar, depending on water levels.\nDue to concerns about king salmon escapement, the personal use fishery will be restricted to no retention of king salmon for the remainder of this season. King salmon caught in the personal use fishery may not be kept. All king salmon caught must be released immediately and returned to the water unharmed.\nChitina Subdistrict Personal Use permits and State of Alaska Sport Fishing licenses are currently available online at the ADF&G store and will also be available at Fish and Game offices and at vendors in Anchorage, Fairbanks and local communities. Glennallen Subdistrict subsistence permits are also available online and at the Fish and Game offices in Anchorage, Delta Junction, Fairbanks, and Palmer.\nCheck the Chitina dipnetting page for more information on the personal use dip net fishery.\nIf you haven't tried dipnetting before, or are interested in some helpful tips, be sure to watch the 4-part video series, \"How to Dipnet for Salmon at Chitina\" at the ADF&G website or on the ADF&G Youtube channel.\nLastly, it’s always a good idea to make sure fishing is open in Chitina before making the drive. Call the 24-hour hotline for the Chitina Subdistrict personal use fishery at 907-822-5224.\n\nGlennallen Subdistrict Subsistence Fishery\n\nThe Glennallen Subdistrict subsistence salmon fishery is currently open and will remain open through September 30.\nGlennallen Subdistrict Subsistence permits are available online at the ADF&G store and at local ADFG offices in Anchorage, Delta Junction, Fairbanks, Glennallen and Palmer.\n\nSport Fishing\n\nFor a guide to local area small fisheries, check out ADFG’s website for Sport fishing Alaska rivers and lakes in the Upper Copper/Upper Susitna River Basin. This guide lists all the fisheries, species available, and mile markers along all the major highways crossing the Upper Copper and Upper Susitna Area.\nEffective on July 7 through August 10, no retention of king salmon is allowed and sport fishing for king salmon throughout the Upper Copper Management Area (i.e., the mainstem Copper River and its tributaries) is limited to catch-and-release only and the use of bait and treble hooks is prohibited in all flowing waters.\nAnglers are reporting limited king salmon action in the Gulkana River from the Richardson Highway Bridge to Sourdough and upstream to the West Fork. Fishing has been reported as slow.\nSockeye salmon fishing on the Klutina River has recently seen an upswing in activity and catchability for fishermen.\nBe sure to watch the ADF&G video, \"How to Fish for Klutina River Red Salmon\" for helpful tips on fishing strategy, access points and camping options.\n\nEmergency Orders\n\nEmergency Order 3-RS-I-15-25 opens the Chitina Subdistrict personal use dip net salmon fishery for a 168-hour period from 12:01 am Monday, July 14 through 11:59 pm Sunday, July 20.\nEmergency Order 3-RS-I-12-25 prohibits the retention of king salmon of any size and prohibits the use of bait and multiple hooks in the sport fisheries occurring in all flowing waters of the Upper Copper River drainage. King salmon may not be retained or possessed, must be released immediately, and may not be removed from the water before releasing the fish.\nEmergency Order 3-RS-I-10-25 closes the Chitina Subdistrict personal use dip net salmon fishery to the retention of king salmon for the remainder of the season.\n\nADF&G News\n\nThe Glennallen ADF&G office has fishing rods to loan out as part of the ADF&G Rod Loaner Program. All you need is a current sport fishing license (for resident anglers 18 and older and non-residents 16 or older) to borrow a rod. You’ll have to provide your own tackle but rods are free of charge.\nMake sure to review the 2025 Northern Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary Booklet for the area you are fishing before you head out.\nBe sure to follow the ADFG Sport Fishing Interior Alaska Facebook page or the ADFG Sport Fishing Interior Alaska Instagram page for the most up-to-date information about fishing in Interior Alaska.

The clearwater rivers are producing decent catches of fish with dry flies and/or small spinners.\nFrom June 1 through March 31, the lower Chena River downstream of the Chena River Dam (located at Chena Lake Recreation Area) has a bag and possession limit of 1 fish any size.\nThis weekend marks the fourth and final weekend for a special youth fishery in the lower Chena River below the Chena River Flood Control Project. Only anglers who are 15 years of age or younger may fish for and retain 1 Arctic grayling of any size per day.\nTry using small spinners (sizes 0-2) and spoons (1/4 to 1/2 oz) if using a spinning rod and small dry flies (sizes 10-16) like caddis, mayflies, midges, mosquitoes, wooly buggers, gnats, etc. for fly fishing.\nCheck out the ADF&G “How To Fish For Arctic Grayling” video to learn the ins and outs of Arctic grayling fishing.\n\nNorthern pike\n\nNorthern pike fishing is productive at this time of year, and fish may be more active with the cooler weather. Try big, flashy spoons and top-water lures to attract their attention near weedy shorelines and slower sections of sloughs.\nNorthern pike fishing in the Tolovana River drainage, including Minto Flats, Minto Lakes and the Chatanika River, opened June 1. The bag and possession limit for northern pike has been reduced by emergency order from 5 fish a day to 2 fish a day, only one of which may be 30 inches or longer.\n\nBurbot\n\nBurbot fishing in the Tanana River has slowed as the river rises, making fishing more difficult. Try fishing bait (herring, whitefish) on the bottom of the river in back eddy areas and slow-moving waters in the mainstem of the Tanana River. Remember, the emergency order for king salmon restricts the use of bait in tributaries of the Tanana River but not in the mainstem of the river.\nIf you get lucky and land a burbot, watch the ADF&G \"How to Clean a Burbot\" video for a quick tutorial on how to fillet your fish.\n\nStocked lakes\n\nThe cooler weather may improve fishing in local stocked lakes as fish become more active.\nStocked rainbows will be hanging near the shallower shoreline weedy patches and Arctic char and lake trout in the cooler deeper sections of the lakes near drop offs, Check the Alaska Lake Database for bathymetric maps of lakes showing the different depths.\nTry fishing small pieces of shrimp or salmon eggs under a bobber or use small, flashy spoons or spinners to entice fish to bite.\nTo increase your chances of catching stocked fish, use small hooks. If you're using bait, a size 10 to 12 hook baited with a single salmon egg or a tiny nib of shrimp works well. If you plan to use a lure, a small size 1 spinner or spoon will get you the most action.\nFor a complete list of stocked lakes in the Interior and statewide, check out the Alaska Lake Database to see when lakes were stocked, how many fish were stocked and what kind of fish were stocked.\nYou can also use the Fish Stocking Search Tool on the ADF&G website for a more detailed search of current stocking information.\nGo the ADF&G website to check out the Tanana River Drainage Stocked Lakes Fishing Guide that has information on all stocked lakes in the Tanana River drainage or pick up a copy at ADF&G offices in Fairbanks and Delta Junction.\n\nEmergency Orders\n\nEmergency Order 3-CS-U-14-25 closes sport fishing for chum salmon in all flowing waters of the Tanana River drainage. Chum salmon may not be targeted and those caught incidentally while fishing for other species may not be removed from the water and must be released immediately.\nEmergency Order 3-KS-U-02-25 closes sport fishing for king salmon in all flowing waters of the Tanana River drainage due to a preseason forecast for a below-average Yukon River king salmon run. This closure prohibits all sport fishing for king salmon, including catch-and-release fishing, in all waters of the Tanana River drainage, including the Chena, Goodpaster and Salcha Rivers. In addition, the use of bait is prohibited in all Tanana River tributaries (i.e. rivers and streams) when fishing for other species. Only unbaited, artificial lures may be used. All king salmon caught incidentally while fishing for other species may not be removed from the water and must be released immediately.\nEmergency Order 3-NP-U-05-25 reduces the bag and possession limit for northern pike in all lakes and flowing waters of the Minto Flats area, including the Chatanika and Tolovana River drainages and Minto Lakes, from five to two fish, only one of which may be 30 inches or longer, from June 1 – October 14, 2025.\n\nADF&G News\n\nBoth the Delta and Fairbanks offices have fishing rods to loan out as part of the ADF&G Rod Loaner Program. All you need is a current sport fishing license (for resident anglers 18 and older and non-residents 16 or older) to borrow a rod. You’ll have to provide your own tackle but rods are free of charge.\nCheck out ADF&G’s public use cabin reservation system to see about renting a free public use cabin on one of six different fishing lakes in the Delta Junction area.\nThe Tanana Valley Fisheries Center in the Ruth Burnett Sport Fish Hatchery at 1150 Wilbur Street in Fairbanks is open to the public Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Stop in to say hi and see what’s growing in the hatchery.\nBe sure to follow the ADFG Sport Fishing Interior Alaska Facebook page or ADFG Sport Fishing Interior Alaska Instagram page for the most up-to-date information about fishing in Interior Alaska.

Be sure to identify what you are catching, as Arctic char and lake trout look very similar and the sport regulations regarding these two species are different.  A few burbot can be caught in the Sagavanirktok, Colville, and Ivishak rivers, as well as Galbraith and Toolik lakes.  Spawning runs of Dolly Varden are in the rivers now, particularly in the Ivishak, Colville, Canning, Hulahula, and Kongakut rivers.  These fish average 3-6 pounds and can be quite aggressive, readily striking spoons, spinners, and large green jigs.  Large sinking flash-flies also work well.  Towards the end of August, larger groups of non-spawning, overwintering Dolly Varden enter these rivers and fishing for them can be good right until freeze-up."

Pink salmon runs are generally very strong in even years.  Spoons, spinners, and flashy flies should work well for both chum and pink salmon.  Fishing for Dolly Varden and Arctic grayling should be good.  Try using small jigs and smolt-imitation flies. Dry flies will catch Arctic grayling as well, with the Fish/Niukluk, Snake, and Sinuk rivers being the best roadside streams to try.  Fishing for northern pike should pick up in the lower Pilgrim and Kuzitrin rivers as the water drops and warms up.  Burbot fishing is generally poor in Norton Sound streams, but there are a few to be caught in the Fish, Pilgrim, and Kuzitrin rivers with fresh bait fished on the bottom.\nKotzebue Sound\nRiver levels are dropping as snowmelt subsides, and fishing for Dolly Varden and Arctic grayling should pick up.  Fishing for Dolly Varden may be slow until mid-July, then pick up and be good through mid-September in the Noatak, Wulik, and Kivalina rivers.  Kobuk River tributaries such as the Squirrel, Salmon, and Hunt rivers should contain Dolly Varden as well. Jigging for herring in the marine waters near Kotzebue should be slowing down now that spawning is finished, but there may still be some found at the seawall in town.  No salmon or sheefish are to be found in rivers quite yet, although you might catch juvenile sheefish (12-20 inches) in the lagoon right in town.  Spoons and rubber soft lures work best, fished close to the bottom.  Northern pike in the lower Noatak, Kobuk, and Selawik rivers will hit these lures as well."

Pink and king salmon fishing winds down in August in Norton Sound streams, but there are still some chum salmon around.  August is coho salmon season, with good runs of these tough fighters found in freshwater rivers throughout the Sound, particularly in the Unalakleet and Fish River drainages but also Snake and Nome rivers.  All types of flashy lures work, as does cured eggs behind a Spin-N-Glo, or just under a bobber.  Coho salmon fishing is generally good throughout the month.  Fishing for Dolly Varden picks up too as more fish enter freshwater rivers to spawn.  Arctic grayling fishing can still be good and egg-imitation flies work really well now.  Dry flies will still catch Arctic grayling as well, with the Fish/Niukluk, Snake, and Sinuk rivers being the best roadside streams to try.

Towards the end of August, large groups of immature and non-spawning Dolly Varden (Dolly Varden only spawn every other year once they become sexually mature in Northwest Alaska) come in to these rivers to overwinter, and in the Wulik River this can number can be over 100,000 fish.  Chum salmon are still moving into the Kobuk and Noatak rivers, however many fish tend to be in spawning colors now and are less palatable than July fish.  The run will remain steady through most of August.  Fishing for sheefish is very good throughout August, with most spawning fish in the river and most fish can be found upriver near spawning areas.  Juvenile sheefish (12-20 inches) can be caught in the lagoon near Kotzebue all summer.  Spoons and soft rubber lures work best, fished close to the bottom.

Sport fishing for other species remains open.  In addition, anglers may use only one unbaited, single-hook, artificial lure in the entire Kuskokwim–Goodnews Area. King salmon begin entering the lower Kuskokwim River during mid-May. Anglers should focus their efforts at the confluences of lower and middle river tributaries as king, sockeye and chum salmon runs continue and peak in the lower river during mid-to late June. In the upper Kuskokwim River, including the Holitna River drainage and other drainages upstream, king salmon sport fishing usually starts in late June, and peaks in the second week of July.\nResident Species Fishing: Many of the local rivers support sheefish, Dolly Varden, burbot, rainbow trout, northern pike and Arctic grayling.  Good fishing opportunities can be expected as water levels continue to decrease. Northern pike fishing improves throughout June as they recover from the rigors of spawning. Anglers will find northern pike in shallow waters that are adjacent to cooler deeper waters. Fishing for burbot at the mouths of Kuskokwim River tributaries is a common local practice.  Setlines are allowed for burbot fishing.  Sheefish migrate up the Kuskokwim River drainage in May and June, and often can be caught with hook and line at the mouths of clear tributaries.  Local high elevation lakes can provide excellent fishing opportunities for char/lake trout and Dolly Varden during the early morning or late evening hours.

Use large streamer flies and colorful spoons to catch these bright red beauties.\nResident Species Fishing:\nThere is limited road accessible sport fishing for northern pike in the Tanana River drainage, the major northern pike fisheries (George, Volkmar and Minto Lakes) are only accessible by boat or floatplane. Northern pike are aggressive summer feeders and fishing with surface lures such as artificial frogs and/or mice is often productive. Because northern pike are fish eaters, large silver spoons and rubber fish patterns also work well. Later in the summer weedless lures are often required, and steel leaders are a must when fishing for northern pike.\nArctic grayling will be distributed throughout the Tanana River tributaries in August (Chena, Salcha, Chatanika, Goodpaster, Delta Clearwater, and Richardson Clearwater rivers). If fly fishing for Arctic grayling you will want to try to “match the hatch” with dry flies, or utilize egg patterns to mimic the salmon eggs plentiful in many Interior rivers. When dry flies aren’t working so well, fishing with nymphs usually works well for fly fishers. Anglers using spinning gear will find that small spoons, spinners, and jigs also provide high catch rates. Cast into pools and slack water eddies for the best success. Fishing is often best in the late evening under the “midnight sun”.\nThere are over 90 stocked lakes in the Tanana River drainage, ranging from large road-accessible lakes such as Quartz and Birch, to lakes with small public use cabins like Lisa Lake and Ken’s Pond, to secluded, remote fly-in or ATV-access only lakes like Dune and Forrest lakes. These lakes are all stocked with one or more fish species. The most common species is rainbow trout; other species include Arctic char, Arctic grayling, and landlocked king and silver salmon. Remote lakes provide a greater opportunity to catch large “trophy” fish, whereas roadside lakes will have high success rates, but smaller fish, making them a popular destination to take young anglers. Jigging small shrimp, salmon eggs, meal worms, and Power bait can often produce high catch rates on stocked lakes. Fishing a baited hook under a bobber, with the bait just off the bottom will usually catch a fish. Small jigs and silver spinners will often work as well. Enticing a fish to a dry fly is always exciting and a thrill when they hit.\nIf practicing catch-and-release, utilize techniques that will enable you to release the fish quickly and will increase the fish’s chances of survival:\n\nUse lures with a single hook or change treble hooks to a single hook,\nDo not fish with bait,\nCrimp down the barb of the hook ,\nKeep the fish in the water when removing the hook\nTo release the fish, hold it gently facing into the current or in water without current gently cradle the fish and move it slowly back and forth until it swims away under its own power."
