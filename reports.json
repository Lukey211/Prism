    "full_text": "Recent Emergency Orders & Press Releases for Petersburg\n\nThe Alaska Department of Fish and Game announced a regional closure for king salmon retention for nonresident anglers starting July 7th. This will impact all waters in the Petersburg/Wrangell Management Area except for the Wrangell Narrows portion of the Terminal Harvest Area (closes August 15th) and City Creek (closes July 14th). This closure is necessary in order to not exceed the 2025 sport allocation of king salmon. Traditionally king salmon catches peak around the third week in June, so if you have not gotten out there now is the time. The Blind Slough/Wrangell Narrows Terminal Hatchery Fishery has been ongoing since May 15th. The majority of marine waters in the Petersburg/Wrangell area are currently open to king salmon retention with the exception being waters adjacent to the Stikine River. There are separate regulations for the Blind Slough/Wrangell Narrows Terminal Harvest Area, City Creek, and the remainder of the region. Please see the Advisory Announcement onour websitefor maps and more specific information about each of these locations. Remember that a king salmon stamp is required whenever fishing for king salmon (including catch and release).\n\nHalibut move up into into shallow waters over the summer. Anglers have been successfully targeting halibut in recent weeks. As the summer progresses you might try fishing offshore of a salmon stream outlet as halibut often eat the fish flushed from the stream after spawning. Anglers can fish the slack tides with heavy duty gear using either whole or cut herring for bait\n\nThe Halibut sport fishery is open February 1 – December 31, 2025. Reminder: Filleting halibut: No person shall possess on board a vessel, including charter vessels and pleasure craft used for fishing, halibut that have been filleted, mutilated, or otherwise disfigured in any manner, except that each halibut may be cut into no more than 2 ventral pieces, 2 dorsal pieces, and 2 cheek pieces, with enough skin on each piece to identify whether the piece is from the light side or the dark side of the fish.\n\nResidents are allowed a daily bag limit of 1; 2 in possession. Nonresidents are allowed a daily bag limit of 1; 1 in possession; 30-35 inches or 55 inches and longer. There is an annual limit of 2 fish, 1 of which is 30-35 inches in length, and 1 that is 55 inches or greater in length. A harvest record is required. The Northern Southeast Area is closed to nonresidents for lingcod fishing from June 15 - August 15, 2025.\n\nRockfish regulations have changed since the last fishing season. The retention of demersal shelf rockfish, including yelloweye, is open for residents of Alaska with a daily bag limit of 1; 2 in possession. Demersal shelf rockfish, including yelloweye, will be open for nonresidents from July 1 through August 25 with an annual limit of 1 fish. Slope Rockfish are open to resident and nonresidents with a daily bag limit of 1; 1 in possession. Pelagic Rockfish are open to resident and nonresidents with a daily bag limit of 3; 6 in possession. A helpful species identification guide has been published on theADFG website. Anglers are reminded that a rockfish release device is now required to be used whenever releasing rockfish, and a rockfish release device must be onboard your vessel whenever sport fishing in marine waters.\n\nDolly Varden and trout remain abundant throughout the creeks. Often overlooked by anglers with their sites on salmon, these smaller fish can offer plenty of fun on lighter tackle. July is a good time to catch these fish, though depending where you are at you might have to avoid the pink salmon that will fill the streams.\n\nAlaska Department of Fish and Game creel samplers have been on the public docks since mid-May approaching anglers to ask about their catch. The biological samples they collect are used to help manage and sustain a healthy stock required for recreational angling. Please be courteous and provide them with the few minutes needed to gather this important information."

In order to not exceed the 2025 sport allocation of king salmon this closure is necessary.\n\nThe closure does not impact resident anglers. Starting July 15th, the remaining saltwater portion of the Petersburg/Wrangell area will open to resident anglers for king salmon retention with a bag and possession limit of one over 28 inches.Traditionally king salmon catches slow down over the next few weeks but they may still be caught.\n\nThere are separate regulations for the Blind Slough/Wrangell Narrows Terminal Harvest Area, City Creek, and the remainder of the region. Please see the Advisory Announcement onour websitefor maps and more specific information about each of these locations. Remember that a king salmon stamp is required whenever fishing for king salmon (including catch and release).\n\nSockeye salmon are in the saltwater now and entering some local streams. Fishing for them may be slow as they are not aggressive feeders and as such catch rates should be expectedly low. Anglers are reminded that snagging is not allowed in any area freshwaters where sockeye salmon are found.\n\nPink and Coho salmon should begin to show. Area coho fishing in marine waters traditionally gets going around the third week in July but there have been some early catches up north so we may see them sooner.\n\nHalibut catch rates tend to remain consistent in July and this is a good species to target this time of year. If looking for halibut locations, target high points under the water that come up to as shallow 100 feet. Another option might be offshore of a creek that has salmon spawning. Halibut catch rates should increase as they come into shallow waters over the summer. Traditional fishing areas such as The Eye Opener in Sumner Strait or north of town in Frederick Sound hold the most promise. Large halibut tend to be at 300 feet or greater, try to fish the slack tides with heavy duty gear and use whole herring for bait. If you are in Petersburg fishing from a small skiff and need to stay close to town, fish just south of the red buoy just outside of Wrangell Narrows in 300 to 400 feet of water.\n\nThe Halibut sport fishery is open February 1 – December 31, 2025.

Kings are also returning to the Medvejie Hatchery and Silver Bay. Currently, there are no special regulations for kings returning to Medvejie or Silver Bay (regional regulations apply). There is a small area near the barrier net behind the net pens at Medvejie that is now closed to fishing in order to allow hatchery staff access to broodstock. Signs are posted. Resident Anglers are allowed one king daily with no annual limit. Nonresident anglers are allowed one per day, with an annual limit ofonefish.\n\nFor other salmon: Coho are starting to show up offshore and there have been reports of them being large for this early. Chum have also recently shown in Sitka Sound in force. Sockeye salmon are starting off strong. As of 6/25, over 1,700 have passed through the Redoubt Weir. It’s still early for Pink Salmon.\n\nOne of the substantial changes for fishing this year is that resident anglers must comply with nonresident fishing regulations when fishing in the EEZ. The EEZ or Exclusive Economic Zone is the water that is generally from 3 miles offshore out to 200 miles. There are some exceptions to this (like Sitka Sound) where there’s an imaginary line that cuts across the sound from offshore of Biorka to Cape Edgcumbe. There are maps depicting this in the 2025 regulatory summary on p. 10 and posted at most of the harbors. While this doesn’t affect nonresidents (there is no differentiation between state waters and the EEZ for nonresidents) resident anglers must comply with nonresident regulations when fishing in the EEZ. This includes any size, bag, or annual limits. Further, anglers may not be in possession of a fish that would be otherwise illegal to possess in the waters in which they are fishing. For example, if a resident angler caught a 45 inch lingcod in state waters (after May 15th), they could not then go out to the EEZ and fish for any species because nonresident anglers are limited to one lingcod between 30 and 35 inches.\n\nResident anglers are subject to and must record any harvest of species that has an annual limit when fishing in the EEZ. This will include king salmon, lingcod, and demersal shelf rockfish in addition to steelhead and sharks (which must be recorded in state waters as well).\n\nFishing for halibut is open. Fishing for halibut is good and stays relatively consistent through the summer. These fish will begin to show up in greater numbers as weather warms and other fisheries move more inshore. SeeNOAAfor sport fishing regulations.\n\nLingcod fishing has been good and is open for residents (no size limit) through November 15th. For nonresidents, lingcod is currently closed, but will reopen on August 16thand will have a 30-35 inch slot limit.\n\nIn 2025,Demersal Shelf Rockfish (DSR) is open year-round for residents. Residents are allowed one fish daily with no annual limit (in State Waters). Nonresidents are allowed one DSR annually from July 1-August 25. Here’s a helpfulrockfish Idlink to common rockfish groups. DSR are a subset of nonpelagic rockfish including: Canary, China, Copper, Quillback, Rosethorn, Tiger, and Yelloweye.\n\nAll anglers are allowedonedaily, two in possession all year with no annual limit. The most common slope rockfish include: Redbanded, Rougheye, Silvergray, Shortraker, and Vermilion.\n\nFishing for pelagic rockfish is open all year and typically good year-round. The most commonly caught pelagic rockfish in the Sitka Area are the Black, Yellowtail, and Dusky. Try fishing around underwater structures near kelp beds with a dart or jig. These rockfish make for excellent table fare.\n\nAnglers are allowed 3 daily, 6 in possession,with the exception of CSEO (Sitka Area), where nonresidents are allowed two daily, four in possession. See the Sitka Area Special Exceptions for a map of CSEO on page 25 of the 2025 Southeast Regulation Summary. The department has developed aguide to assist anglers in identifying species groupings.

Also be aware that certain types of shellfish in Southeast Alaska have been known to cause Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) which can be fatal. For Dungeness crab, try placing pots in bays and around the mouths of river where crabs congregate to feed.

    "full_text": "Recent Emergency Orders & Press Releases for Yakutat\n\nSockeye fishing has been non-existent this past week due to two major rainstorms that rolled through Yakutat and basically over-filled the Situk River. The river peaked in discharge late Sunday evening around ~1,700 cfs. Water levels over 600 cfs pretty much make wade fishing impossible, so fishing has been put on hold since Saturday. One of the other casualties of the high water this weekend was the weir, which blew out sometime late Sunday night. As a result there have been no fish counts for almost six days. Prior to the weir washing out, the crew had passed over 5,000 sockeye in two days with more behind it. It was starting to look like another good run. The good news is that water levels are dropping, and knock on wood (hold on, let me do it.....there), the long-term forecast is looking good with a possible shift into the correct weather pattern for this time of year. Currently the water discharge is at ~500 cfs and dropping. Water should continue to drop and fishing conditions should be good for the foreseeable future. The 9-mile Bridge fishing closure goes into effect on Sunday, June 15th.\n\nDolly fishing should be excellent. Large numbers of Dolly Varden are present in the Situk River and other freshwaters in the Yakutat management area. They are feasting on emigrating pink salmon fry, and salmon smolt. Almost any lure or fly can be used to catch them.\n\nCutthroat trout fishing continues to be excellent right now. The best location to target them is Tawah Creek. They are spread throughout the drainage and are similar to Dolly Varden in that you can use a variety of lures or flies to target them.\n\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters. Fishing over the last week continued to be spotty for saltwater king salmon. Some good catches were observed in Old Chicago Bay, Knight Island, and Logdump. Most anglers troll spoons or herring behind a flasher. Please check the department website below for the recent emergency order and advisory announcements regarding 2025 regional king salmon regulations for Southeast Alaska.\n\nHalibut fishing was slow this last week with the bad weather constantly rolling through. Dogfish are present already making it difficult finding halibut. Smaller fish were brought in this week, with the occassional big fish brought in. The good news is that the marine forecast is setting up really nice for the next week. Folks should take advantage of the upcoming good weather and get out on the salt! Anglers are anchoring up and soaking herring/octopus/salmon heads on circle hooks or using baited jigs as they drift.\n\nLingcod fishing is open in the Yakutat area.Fishing has been excellent so far. Please check the department website for the recent emergency order and advisory annoucements regarding changes to lingcod regulations in the Yakutat management area. Using a variety of jigs (lead-head, dart) over rocky structures is the best method for catching lingcod, although a double snelled octopus hook set-up baited with herring works well too.\n\nFishing for rockfish is good in the Yakutat area. Dart jigs or mooching with herring over rocky pinnacles works best. Please check the department website for the recent emergency order and advisory annoucements regarding changes to rockfish regulations in 2025 for Southeast Alaska.\n\nFor further information, please get in touch with the Yakutat Area Sport Fish management biologist Jason Pawluk at(907) 784-3222.\n\nEmergency orders can befound on our website.\n\nCheck out the newgofishakinteractive map to discover popular fishing locations and information on species run timing, fishing gear selections, and boat and angler access tips!"

Water levels are at normal and has made fishing quite good. The weir is back up and running and counts are projecting a good run so far. The long term forecast calls for rain so weather isn't looking too hot, but the rain levels shouldn't be enough to push anglers off the river this time around. Fishing should be good for the next few weeks. The Situk River within 50 yards of both upstream/downstream of the 9-mile Bridge is closed to sport fishing.\n\nDolly fishing should be excellent. Large numbers of Dolly Varden are present in the Situk River and other freshwaters in the Yakutat management area. They are feasting on emigrating pink salmon fry, and salmon smolt. Almost any lure or fly can be used to catch them. Try mimicking salmon smolt or fry when choosing a lure.\n\nCutthroat trout fishing continues to be excellent right now. The best location to target them is Tawah Creek. The Tawah Creek within 50 yards of both upstream/downstream of the Cannon Beach Road Bridge is closed to sport fishing. They are spread throughout the drainage and are similar to Dolly Varden in that you can use a variety of lures or flies to target them.\n\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters. Fishing for kings this last week was pretty slow in most places. The hot spot this last week definetly was Monti Bay in locations like Point Turner, Point Munoz, and Point Carrew. Regular drags inside the islands were pretty devoid of fish this last week. Most anglers troll spoons or herring behind a flasher. Please check the department website below for the recent emergency order and advisory announcements regarding 2025 regional king salmon regulations for Southeast Alaska.\n\nHalibut fishing was excellent this last week with regards to weather and nice fish being caught. The weather has allowed anglers to get out to wherever they want to this last week, with most anglers going out front of Yakutat Bay. Catches were good early, but slowed some around the area around Buoy #2. Sounds like anglers are moving around to find bigger halibut to such places as Point Mambi and in the back of Yakutat Bay. The forecast looks decent this next week, but there are a few wind events so the seas will be a little lumpier than last week for sure but still doable. Anglers are anchoring up and soaking herring/octopus/salmon heads on circle hooks or using baited jigs as they drift.\n\nLingcod fishing is open in the Yakutat area.Fishing has been excellent so far.

Weir counts have us tracking above the escapement goal range, with over 30,000 fish estimated to have gone past the weir so far at roughly 30% of the run historically. As a result, the bag limit for sockeye salmon on the Situk River increases from 3 per day to 6 per day on Friday, July 4th. Fish are spread through out the river. The long term forecast calls for rain all next week at decent levels, so rising water levels are expected late this weekend. Rising water levels shouldn't prevent fishing, especially boat fishing, but could make wade shore fishing a little more difficult. Fishing should be good for the next few weeks. The Situk River within 50 yards of both upstream/downstream of the 9-mile Bridge is closed to sport fishing.\n\nDolly fishing should be excellent. Large numbers of Dolly Varden are present in the Situk River and other freshwaters in the Yakutat management area. They are feasting on emigrating pink salmon fry, and salmon smolt. Almost any lure or fly can be used to catch them. Try mimicking salmon smolt or fry when choosing a lure.\n\nCutthroat trout fishing continues to be excellent right now. The best location to target them is Tawah Creek. The Tawah Creek within 50 yards of both upstream/downstream of the Cannon Beach Road Bridge is closed to sport fishing. They are spread throughout the drainage and are similar to Dolly Varden in that you can use a variety of lures or flies to target them.\n\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters. Fishing for kings this last week continued to be spotty. Fishing for king salmon closes to non-resident anglers on Monday, July 7th. Most anglers troll spoons or herring behind a flasher. Please check the department website below for the recent emergency order and advisory announcements regarding 2025 regional king salmon regulations for Southeast Alaska.\n\nHalibut fishing this past week was good, however alot of smaller fish are being caught compared to earlier in the season. The weather has allowed anglers to get out to wherever they want to this last week, with most anglers going out front of Yakutat Bay. Dogfish are present, so moving around to avoid them might be necessary. We are in the middle of the halibut season, so fishing should remain good for the next month or so. The forecast looks a little rough next week with rain and wind event scattered throughout. Anglers are anchoring up and soaking herring/octopus/salmon heads on circle hooks or using baited jigs as they drift.\n\nLingcod fishing is open in the Yakutat area.Fishing has been excellent so far. Please check the department website for the recent emergency order and advisory annoucements regarding changes to lingcod regulations in the Yakutat management area. Using a variety of jigs (lead-head, dart) over rocky structures is the best method for catching lingcod, although a double snelled octopus hook set-up baited with herring works well too.\n\nFishing for rockfish is good in the Yakutat area. Dart jigs or mooching with herring over rocky pinnacles works best. Please check the department website for the recent emergency order and advisory annoucements regarding changes to rockfish regulations in 2025 for Southeast Alaska.\n\nFor further information, please get in touch with the Yakutat Area Sport Fish management biologist Jason Pawluk at(907) 784-3222.\n\nEmergency orders can befound on our website.\n\nCheck out the newgofishakinteractive map to discover popular fishing locations and information on species run timing, fishing gear selections, and boat and angler access tips!"

    "full_text": "Recent Emergency Orders & Press Releases for Juneau\n\nKing salmon fishing continues to be strong throughout the Juneau area, with the Terminal Harvest Area (THA) remaining productive. While most of the early-season action was concentrated in the southern portion of the THA, the bite has now shifted north.\n\nAnglers are currently having the most success in areas like Lena Cove and the North Douglas/Fritz Cove area, which have become the latest hot spots. The south end of Gastineau Channel is still producing a few fish, but not at the pace seen earlier in the season.\n\nIn addition to kings, we’re starting to see a good number of coho showing up on the docks! Anglers are harvesting cohos from Pt. Retreat, North Shelter and Lincoln Islands, Funter Bay, and around Benjamin Island. Chums and pinks are also coming in, with most of them being caught in the same areas where coho are being found.\n\nOverall, the season is in full swing and fishing opportunities continue to be strong in the Juneau area.\n\nThe Juneau area is fortunate to have a THA where both residents and nonresidents can continue to harvest king salmon within the designated boundaries. It is important to note thatsport fishing for king salmon and all snagging is prohibited within a300-yard radius of the Wayside Park Fishing Dockto protect salmon attempting to reach the fish ladder at the Macaulay Salmon Hatchery.\n\nFor comprehensive details on specific areas, including maps, bag limits, and possession regulations, please refer to our latestadvisory announcements and emergency orders. Stay informed on the most current regulations and any recent changes.\n\nHalibut fishing is in full swing, and anglers are having solid success throughout the Juneau area. We’re now in the prime of the season, and more people are targeting halibut with good results.\n\nSome of the hottest spots continue to be North Shelter and Lincoln Island, along with Homeshore, Benjamin Island, and the waters around Hoonah/Icy Strait Point. While these areas are producing consistently, halibut are being caught in many other locations as well.\n\nIf you’ve been thinking about heading out, now’s a great time to go!\n\nIt's important to note that halibut fishing is federally managed. For detailed information on sport fishing regulations and guidelines forcharter (guided)vsunguided halibutregulations in Southeast Alaska, please visitNOAA's website.\n\nA few sablefish have been harvested recently near Point Howard, Couverden Rocks, and the Lynn Sisters. These deep-dwelling fish can be challenging to target, but for those willing to put in the effort, the reward is well worth it.\n\nDeepwater release devices are mandatory for all saltwater vessels.All vessels must have at least one functional deepwater release mechanism on board and readily available for use when sport fishing activities are taking place regardless of species targeted.\n\nAll rockfish not retained must be released at the depth they were caught or 100 feet, whichever is shallower.\n\nPlease visit our link to view deep water release deviceexamples and tipsand how these mechanisms are a helpful tool forconservation.\n\nAnglers are beginning to see more consistent rockfish catches around the Juneau area, coinciding with the recent uptick in halibut fishing. Duskies have made up the bulk of the reports so far, with a few Silvergray, Rougheye, Quillback, Redbanded, and Yelloweye rockfish also starting to show up on the docks. Most of these rockfish have been caught in the waters near North Shelter, Lincoln Island, Benjamin Island, and Point Retreat. As always, please follow current regulations and handle any released fish with care to help support the long-term health of these valuable stocks.\n\nNot all rockfish species found in Alaska are listed above. For a complete list of species you may encounter in Alaska, please visitour website.\n\nIn mid-summer, Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout have begun moving into local creeks to feast on salmon eggs. The best way to catch these fish is by using egg patterns or small spinners and spoons. Make sure to visitGo Fish AKand explore the interactive map to identify the species you're interested in fishing for.\n\nIn all drainages crossed by the Juneau road system, as well as the saltwater adjacent to the Juneau road system to a line 1/4 mile offshore, cutthroat and rainbow trout bag limits (in combination) are 2 daily, 2 in possession with a 14-inch minimum and 22-inch maximum size limit. Dolly Varden limits are 2 daily, 2 in possession, no size limit. Anglers should check the 2025Southeast Alaska Sport Fish Regulation Summaryor special regulations specific to the stream or lake they intend to fish.\n\nPersonal use red and blue king crab fishing opened on July 1st, exclusively for Alaskan residents.To participate, anglers must hold a valid sport fishing license along with a 2025/2026 Southeast Alaska Regional Personal Use King Crab Permit. These are available atthe ADF&G online store. Please check for Personal UseEmergency Orders, legal-size and pot configurations, and restrictions online.Section 11-A is currently CLOSED to Alaskan resident PU king crab fishing. Stay tuned for the Juneau area PU announcement later this year using the link above. Harvest must bereported online. Please check the 2025 Southeast Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary bookletpages 34-37for regulations specific to shellfish.\n\nFor Alaskan residents in the Juneau area, licensed anglers may retain up to 20 male Dungeness crabs, with a minimum width of 6 1/2 inches and 30 male Tanner crabs, with a minimum width of 5 1/2 inches. While taking Dungeness crab, 5 pots or 10 rings per person may be used, with a max of 10 pots or 20 rings per vessel. While taking Tanner crab, no more than 4 pots or 10 rings per vessel may be used. In total, no more than 5 pots per person and 10 pots per vessel may be used for taking shellfish regardless of pot type.\n\nFor nonresidents in the Juneau area, licensed anglers can keep 3 male Tanner and Dungeness crab (in combination). Tanner males need to be 5 1/2 inch minimum width and Dungeness males need to be 6 1/2 inch minimum width.\n\nSport and personal use shrimp fisheries in the Juneau and Tenakee area will remain CLOSEDuntil further notice. The closed area consists of all marine waters of Section 11-A north and west of a line extending from a regulatory marker near point Bishop to the Coast Guard marker and light on Point Arden, extending to a line at the latitude of Little Island light, and east of a line from Little Island light to Point Retreat light. And the Tenakee closed area consists of all marine waters in Tenakee Inlet west of the longitude of Corner Point at 135° 06.50' W long. Check theSport and Personal Use Advisory Announcement,\n\nOutside the Juneau 11-A and Tenakee Inlet areas, sport and personal use shrimp fishing remains open. Sport and personal use shrimpers who have a valid sport fishing license must also have a free shrimp permit available on theADF&G online store. Participating anglers must sign their permit in ink to make it valid and have the permit in possession while taking shrimp in Southeast Alaska. Shrimp limits and gear requirements for sport and personal use shrimp fishing cab be found onpages 34-37of the 2025 Southeast Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary.Reportingof effort and harvest is required and must be submitted to the department even if you did not fish.\n\nADF&G does not recommend harvesting clams from any waters in the Juneau area due to the possibility that the clams may contain Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) toxins. Currently, no beaches in the Juneau area are monitored on a regular basis (i.e- \"certified\") for PSP toxins. If you harvest, you do so at your own risk of PSP poisoning. Sporadic sampling has been conducted by theSoutheast Alaska Tribal Ocean Research (SEATOR)project, but clams of any species and at any time during the year may still contain toxic levels of PSP. Please navigate to the followingDepartment of Environmental Conservation (DEC) web pagefor more information about PSP.\n\nCheck out thewefishakpage on the ADF&G website for the newJuneau-Glacier Bay Interactive Mapto discover popular fishing locations and information on species run timing, fishing gear selections, and boat and angler access tips through the Sport Fishgofishak application."

    "full_text": "Recent Emergency Orders & Press Releases for Ketchikan\n\nADF&G announced a regional closure for king salmon retention for nonresidents beginning July 7. This will impact all waters in the Ketchikan Management Area except for the Herring Bay Terminal Harvest Area, which will remain open through July 31. The regional closure is necessary to keep the sport fishery within the 2025 sport allocation.\n\nKing salmon fishing has been strong, with the latter half of June and early July typically considered the peak period. Productive king salmon fishing areas around Ketchikan include the backside of Gravina Island, Clover Pass, and Herring Bay.\n\nA few summer coho are starting to show up, and catch rates are expected to improve as we move through July.\n\nHalibut fishing has picked up throughout June and is expected to remain strong throughout July. As the summer progresses, halibut will continue moving into shallower waters, improving access for anglers. Productive areas include Duke Island, Gravina Island/Vallenar Point, and Cape Chacon.\n\nLingcod fishing has been good.\n\nRockfish can be caught year-round. Stop by the Fish & Game office or visit the website for resources onidentifying rockfish species. All sportfishing vessels are required to have at least one deep water release device on board.\n\nDemersal shelf rockfish are the following species: yelloweye, quillback, canary, China, copper, tiger, and rosethorn.\n\nPelagic rockfish species include black, dark, dusky, widow, and yellowtail.\n\nTrout and Dolly Varden fishing is good in rivers and lakes throughout July. It is often an overlooked fishery while anglers target salmon. With lighter tackle and abundant fish, anglers often find success. When fishing lakes, concentrate your efforts near the inlet and outlet, where fish tend to congregate. Early July is a good time to target these fish before pink salmon begin moving into freshwater.\n\nADF&G creel technicians are on the docks interviewing anglers, participation is important and only takes a couple of minutes. During an interview, creel samplers will ask a few short questions about your fishing trip and collect biological data from the fish harvested. The data collected through this program is essential for the sustainable management of sport fisheries, guiding management decisions to ensure fishing and harvest opportunities are maintained for the future.\n\nAn excellent resource for planning a trip is thegofishakinteractive map for Ketchikan which provides information on popular fishing locations, species run timing, fishing gear selections and boat and angler access."

    "full_text": "Recent Emergency Orders & Press Releases for Petersburg\n\nRegionally king salmon retention is currently closed for nonresidents in all waters in the Petersburg/Wrangell Management Area except for the Wrangell Narrows portion of the Terminal Harvest Area (closes August 15th) and City Creek (closes July 14th). In order to not exceed the 2025 sport allocation of king salmon this closure is necessary.\n\nThe closure does not impact resident anglers. Starting July 15th, the remaining saltwater portion of the Petersburg/Wrangell area will open to resident anglers for king salmon retention with a bag and possession limit of one over 28 inches.Traditionally king salmon catches slow down over the next few weeks but they may still be caught.\n\nThere are separate regulations for the Blind Slough/Wrangell Narrows Terminal Harvest Area, City Creek, and the remainder of the region. Please see the Advisory Announcement onour websitefor maps and more specific information about each of these locations. Remember that a king salmon stamp is required whenever fishing for king salmon (including catch and release).\n\nSockeye salmon are in the saltwater now and entering some local streams. Fishing for them may be slow as they are not aggressive feeders and as such catch rates should be expectedly low. Anglers are reminded that snagging is not allowed in any area freshwaters where sockeye salmon are found.\n\nPink and Coho salmon should begin to show. Area coho fishing in marine waters traditionally gets going around the third week in July but there have been some early catches up north so we may see them sooner.\n\nHalibut catch rates tend to remain consistent in July and this is a good species to target this time of year. If looking for halibut locations, target high points under the water that come up to as shallow 100 feet. Another option might be offshore of a creek that has salmon spawning. Halibut catch rates should increase as they come into shallow waters over the summer. Traditional fishing areas such as The Eye Opener in Sumner Strait or north of town in Frederick Sound hold the most promise. Large halibut tend to be at 300 feet or greater, try to fish the slack tides with heavy duty gear and use whole herring for bait. If you are in Petersburg fishing from a small skiff and need to stay close to town, fish just south of the red buoy just outside of Wrangell Narrows in 300 to 400 feet of water.\n\nThe Halibut sport fishery is open February 1 – December 31, 2025. Reminder: Filleting halibut: No person shall possess on board a vessel, including charter vessels and pleasure craft used for fishing, halibut that have been filleted, mutilated, or otherwise disfigured in any manner, except that each halibut may be cut into no more than 2 ventral pieces, 2 dorsal pieces, and 2 cheek pieces, with enough skin on each piece to identify whether the piece is from the light side or the dark side of the fish.\n\nResidents are allowed a daily bag limit of 1; 2 in possession. Nonresidents are allowed a daily bag limit of 1; 1 in possession; 30-35 inches or 55 inches and longer. There is an annual limit of 2 fish, 1 of which is 30-35 inches in length, and 1 that is 55 inches or greater in length. A harvest record is required. The Northern Southeast Area is closed to nonresidents for lingcod fishing from June 15 - August 15, 2025.\n\nRockfish regulations have changed since the last fishing season. The retention of demersal shelf rockfish, including yelloweye, is open for residents of Alaska with a daily bag limit of 1; 2 in possession. Demersal shelf rockfish, including yelloweye, will be open for nonresidents from July 1 through August 25 with an annual limit of 1 fish. Slope Rockfish are open to resident and nonresidents with a daily bag limit of 1; 1 in possession. Pelagic Rockfish are open to resident and nonresidents with a daily bag limit of 3; 6 in possession. A helpful species identification guide has been published on theADFG website. Anglers are reminded that a rockfish release device is now required to be used whenever releasing rockfish, and a rockfish release device must be onboard your vessel whenever sport fishing in marine waters.\n\nResident cutthroat and Dolly Varden can also be found in area streams and lakes accessible by the Petersburg and Wrangell road systems. Often overlooked by anglers with their sites on salmon, these smaller fish can offer plenty of fun on lighter tackle. July is a good time to catch these fish, though depending on where you are at you might have to avoid the pink salmon that will fill the streams.\n\nAlaska Department of Fish and Game creel samplers have been on the public docks since mid-May approaching anglers to ask about their catch. The biological samples they collect are used to help manage and sustain a healthy stock required for recreational angling. Please be courteous and provide them with the few minutes needed to gather this important information."

    "full_text": "Recent Emergency Orders & Press Releases for Sitka\n\nKing salmon fishing has been good with anglers reporting in many areas around Sitka – including the typical locations (Biorka, Vitskari, and off Kruzoff). Kings are also returning to the Medvejie Hatchery and Silver Bay. Currently, there are no special regulations for kings returning to Medvejie or Silver Bay (regional regulations apply). There is a small area near the barrier net behind the net pens at Medvejie that is now closed to fishing in order to allow hatchery staff access to broodstock. Signs are posted. Resident Anglers are allowed one king daily with no annual limit. The nonresident king fishery isclosedas of July 7th.\n\nFor other salmon: Coho are starting to show up offshore and there have been reports of them being large for this early. Chum have also recently shown in Sitka Sound in force. Sockeye salmon are starting off strong. As of 7/6, over 39,900 have passed through the Redoubt Weir. It’s still early for Pink Salmon.\n\nOne of the substantial changes for fishing this year is that resident anglers must comply with nonresident fishing regulations when fishing in the EEZ. The EEZ or Exclusive Economic Zone is the water that is generally from 3 miles offshore out to 200 miles. There are some exceptions to this (like Sitka Sound) where there’s an imaginary line that cuts across the sound from offshore of Biorka to Cape Edgcumbe. There are maps depicting this in the 2025 regulatory summary on p. 10 and posted at most of the harbors. While this doesn’t affect nonresidents (there is no differentiation between state waters and the EEZ for nonresidents) resident anglers must comply with nonresident regulations when fishing in the EEZ. This includes any size, bag, or annual limits. Further, anglers may not be in possession of a fish that would be otherwise illegal to possess in the waters in which they are fishing. For example, if a resident angler caught a 45 inch lingcod in state waters (after May 15th), they could not then go out to the EEZ and fish for any species because nonresident anglers are limited to one lingcod between 30 and 35 inches.\n\nResident anglers are subject to and must record any harvest of species that has an annual limit when fishing in the EEZ. This will include king salmon, lingcod, and nonpelagic rockfish in addition to steelhead and sharks (which must be recorded in state waters as well).\n\nFishing for halibut is open. Fishing for halibut is good and stays relatively consistent through the summer. These fish will begin to show up in greater numbers as weather warms and other fisheries move more inshore. SeeNOAAfor sport fishing regulations.\n\nFor all anglers, the fishing season openedMay 16. The resident season will run through the end of November.There is amidseason closurefor nonresident anglers From June 15th through August 15. Fishing for lingcod has been good.\n\nIn 2025,Demersal Shelf Rockfish (DSR) is open year-round for residents. Residents are allowed one fish daily with no annual limit (in State Waters). Nonresidents are allowed one DSR daily and one annually from July 1-August 25. Here’s a helpfulrockfish Idlink to common rockfish groups. DSR are a subset of nonpelagic rockfish including: Yelloweye, Quillback, China, Tiger, Rosethorn, Copper, and Canary.\n\nAll anglers are allowedonedaily, two in possession all year with no annual limit. The most common slope rockfish include: Redbanded, Rougheye, Silvergray, Shortraker, and Vermilion.\n\nFishing for pelagic rockfish is open all year and typically good year-round. The most commonly caught pelagic rockfish in the Sitka Area are the Black and Yellowtail, although Duskys aren’t uncommon. Try fishing around underwater structures near kelp beds with a dart or jig. These rockfish make for excellent table fare.\n\nAnglers are allowed five daily, ten in possession, with theexception of CSEO (Sitka Area),where residents are allowed three a day, six in possession, and nonresidents are allowed two daily, four in possession. See the Sitka Area Special Exceptions for a map of CSEO on page 25 of the 2025 Southeast Regulation Summary. The department has developed aguideto assist anglers in identifying species groupings. If you’d like a copy of this on waterproof paper, stop by the office for a free one.\n\nBe sure to check your local fishing regulations to be aware of harvest limits, size requirements and necessary permits for shellfish. Also be aware that certain types of shellfish in Southeast Alaska have been known to cause Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) which can be fatal.\n\nFor Dungeness crab, try placing pots in bays and around the mouths of river where crabs congregate to feed. If fishing with friends, be sure to keep each angler’s catch separate to avoid pooling bag limits.\n\nCheck out the newgofishakinteractive map to discover popular fishing locations and information on species run timing, fishing gear selections, and boat and angler access tips!\n\nFor further information, please feel free to contact the Sitka area sportfish management staff at(907) 747-5355."

    "full_text": "Recent Emergency Orders & Press Releases for Yakutat\n\nSockeye fishing continues to be good on the Situk River. Water levels are normal and have made fishing quite good. Weir counts have us tracking above the escapement goal range, with over 40,000 fish estimated to have gone past the weir so far at roughly 48% of the run historically. As a result, the bag limit for sockeye salmon on the Situk River has increased from 3 per day to 6 per day. Fish are spread through out the river. The Situk River within 50 yards of both upstream/downstream of the 9-mile Bridge is closed to sport fishing.\n\nDolly fishing should be excellent. Large numbers of Dolly Varden are present in the Situk River and other freshwaters in the Yakutat management area. They are feasting on emigrating pink salmon fry, and salmon smolt. Almost any lure or fly can be used to catch them. Try mimicking salmon smolt or fry when choosing a lure.\n\nCutthroat trout fishing continues to be excellent right now. The best location to target them is Tawah Creek. The Tawah Creek within 50 yards of both upstream/downstream of the Cannon Beach Road Bridge is closed to sport fishing. They are spread throughout the drainage and are similar to Dolly Varden in that you can use a variety of lures or flies to target them.\n\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters. Fishing for kings this last week was very slow. Fishing for king salmon closed to non-resident anglers on Monday, July 7th. Most anglers troll spoons or herring behind a flasher. Please check the department website below for the recent emergency order and advisory announcements regarding 2025 regional king salmon regulations for Southeast Alaska.\n\nHalibut fishing this past week was good, however more smaller fish continue to be caught compared to earlier in the season, however some really nice fish are being caught for those who can get out farther offshore. The marine weather has been good for the most part and has allowed anglers to get out to wherever they want to this last week, with most anglers going out front of Yakutat Bay. Dogfish are present, so moving around to avoid them might be necessary. We are in the middle of the halibut season, so fishing should remain good for the next month or so. The forecast looks a little rough next week with rain and wind event scattered throughout. Anglers are anchoring up and soaking herring/octopus/salmon heads on circle hooks or using baited jigs as they drift.\n\nLingcod fishing is open in the Yakutat area.Fishing has been excellent so far. Please check the department website for the recent emergency order and advisory annoucements regarding changes to lingcod regulations in the Yakutat management area. Using a variety of jigs (lead-head, dart) over rocky structures is the best method for catching lingcod, although a double snelled octopus hook set-up baited with herring works well too.\n\nFishing for rockfish is good in the Yakutat area. Dart jigs or mooching with herring over rocky pinnacles works best. Please check the department website for the recent emergency order and advisory annoucements regarding changes to rockfish regulations in 2025 for Southeast Alaska.\n\nFor further information, please get in touch with the Yakutat Area Sport Fish management biologist Jason Pawluk at(907) 784-3222.\n\nEmergency orders can befound on our website.\n\nCheck out the newgofishakinteractive map to discover popular fishing locations and information on species run timing, fishing gear selections, and boat and angler access tips!"

While most of the early-season action was concentrated in the southern portion of the THA, the bite has now shifted north.\n\nAnglers are currently having the most success in areas like Lena Cove and the North Douglas/Fritz Cove area, which have become the latest hot spots. The south end of Gastineau Channel is still producing a few fish, but not at the pace seen earlier in the season.\n\nIn addition to kings, we’re starting to see a good number of coho showing up on the docks! Anglers are harvesting cohos from Pt. Retreat, North Shelter and Lincoln Islands, Funter Bay, and around Benjamin Island. Chums and pinks are also coming in, with most of them being caught in the same areas where coho are being found.\n\nOverall, the season is in full swing and fishing opportunities continue to be strong in the Juneau area.\n\nThe Juneau area is fortunate to have a THA where both residents and nonresidents can continue to harvest king salmon within the designated boundaries. It is important to note thatsport fishing for king salmon and all snagging is prohibited within a300-yard radius of the Wayside Park Fishing Dockto protect salmon attempting to reach the fish ladder at the Macaulay Salmon Hatchery.\n\nFor comprehensive details on specific areas, including maps, bag limits, and possession regulations, please refer to our latestadvisory announcements and emergency orders. Stay informed on the most current regulations and any recent changes.\n\nHalibut fishing is in full swing, and anglers are having solid success throughout the Juneau area. We’re now in the prime of the season, and more people are targeting halibut with good results.\n\nSome of the hottest spots continue to be North Shelter and Lincoln Island, along with Homeshore, Benjamin Island, and the waters around Hoonah/Icy Strait Point. While these areas are producing consistently, halibut are being caught in many other locations as well.\n\nIf you’ve been thinking about heading out, now’s a great time to go!\n\nIt's important to note that halibut fishing is federally managed. For detailed information on sport fishing regulations and guidelines forcharter (guided)vsunguided halibutregulations in Southeast Alaska, please visitNOAA's website.\n\nA few sablefish have been harvested recently near Point Howard, Couverden Rocks, and the Lynn Sisters. These deep-dwelling fish can be challenging to target, but for those willing to put in the effort, the reward is well worth it.\n\nDeepwater release devices are mandatory for all saltwater vessels.All vessels must have at least one functional deepwater release mechanism on board and readily available for use when sport fishing activities are taking place regardless of species targeted.\n\nAll rockfish not retained must be released at the depth they were caught or 100 feet, whichever is shallower.\n\nPlease visit our link to view deep water release deviceexamples and tipsand how these mechanisms are a helpful tool forconservation.\n\nAnglers are beginning to see more consistent rockfish catches around the Juneau area, coinciding with the recent uptick in halibut fishing. Duskies have made up the bulk of the reports so far, with a few Silvergray, Rougheye, Quillback, Redbanded, and Yelloweye rockfish also starting to show up on the docks. Most of these rockfish have been caught in the waters near North Shelter, Lincoln Island, Benjamin Island, and Point Retreat. As always, please follow current regulations and handle any released fish with care to help support the long-term health of these valuable stocks.\n\nNot all rockfish species found in Alaska are listed above. For a complete list of species you may encounter in Alaska, please visitour website.\n\nIn mid-summer, Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout have begun moving into local creeks to feast on salmon eggs. The best way to catch these fish is by using egg patterns or small spinners and spoons. Make sure to visitGo Fish AKand explore the interactive map to identify the species you're interested in fishing for.\n\nIn all drainages crossed by the Juneau road system, as well as the saltwater adjacent to the Juneau road system to a line 1/4 mile offshore, cutthroat and rainbow trout bag limits (in combination) are 2 daily, 2 in possession with a 14-inch minimum and 22-inch maximum size limit. Dolly Varden limits are 2 daily, 2 in possession, no size limit. Anglers should check the 2025Southeast Alaska Sport Fish Regulation Summaryor special regulations specific to the stream or lake they intend to fish.\n\nPersonal use red and blue king crab fishing opened on July 1st, exclusively for Alaskan residents.To participate, anglers must hold a valid sport fishing license along with a 2025/2026 Southeast Alaska Regional Personal Use King Crab Permit.

While taking Dungeness crab, 5 pots or 10 rings per person may be used, with a max of 10 pots or 20 rings per vessel. While taking Tanner crab, no more than 4 pots or 10 rings per vessel may be used. In total, no more than 5 pots per person and 10 pots per vessel may be used for taking shellfish regardless of pot type.\n\nFor nonresidents in the Juneau area, licensed anglers can keep 3 male Tanner and Dungeness crab (in combination). Tanner males need to be 5 1/2 inch minimum width and Dungeness males need to be 6 1/2 inch minimum width.\n\nSport and personal use shrimp fisheries in the Juneau and Tenakee area will remain CLOSEDuntil further notice. The closed area consists of all marine waters of Section 11-A north and west of a line extending from a regulatory marker near point Bishop to the Coast Guard marker and light on Point Arden, extending to a line at the latitude of Little Island light, and east of a line from Little Island light to Point Retreat light. And the Tenakee closed area consists of all marine waters in Tenakee Inlet west of the longitude of Corner Point at 135° 06.50' W long.

Sport and personal use shrimpers who have a valid sport fishing license must also have a free shrimp permit available on theADF&G online store. Participating anglers must sign their permit in ink to make it valid and have the permit in possession while taking shrimp in Southeast Alaska. Shrimp limits and gear requirements for sport and personal use shrimp fishing cab be found onpages 34-37of the 2025 Southeast Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary.Reportingof effort and harvest is required and must be submitted to the department even if you did not fish.\n\nADF&G does not recommend harvesting clams from any waters in the Juneau area due to the possibility that the clams may contain Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) toxins. Currently, no beaches in the Juneau area are monitored on a regular basis (i.e- \"certified\") for PSP toxins. If you harvest, you do so at your own risk of PSP poisoning. Sporadic sampling has been conducted by theSoutheast Alaska Tribal Ocean Research (SEATOR)project, but clams of any species and at any time during the year may still contain toxic levels of PSP. Please navigate to the followingDepartment of Environmental Conservation (DEC) web pagefor more information about PSP.\n\nCheck out thewefishakpage on the ADF&G website for the newJuneau-Glacier Bay Interactive Mapto discover popular fishing locations and information on species run timing, fishing gear selections, and boat and angler access tips through the Sport Fishgofishak application."

    "full_text": "Recent Emergency Orders & Press Releases for Ketchikan\n\nADF&G announced a regional closure for king salmon retention for nonresidents beginning July 7. This will impact all waters in the Ketchikan Management Area except for the Herring Bay Terminal Harvest Area, which will remain open through July 31. The regional closure is necessary to keep the sport fishery within the 2025 sport allocation.\n\nKing salmon fishing has been strong, with the latter half of June and early July typically considered the peak period. Productive king salmon fishing areas around Ketchikan include the backside of Gravina Island, Clover Pass, and Herring Bay.\n\nA few summer coho are starting to show up, and catch rates are expected to improve as we move through July.\n\nHalibut fishing has picked up throughout June and is expected to remain strong throughout July. As the summer progresses, halibut will continue moving into shallower waters, improving access for anglers. Productive areas include Duke Island, Gravina Island/Vallenar Point, and Cape Chacon.\n\nLingcod fishing has been good.\n\nRockfish can be caught year-round. Stop by the Fish & Game office or visit the website for resources onidentifying rockfish species. All sportfishing vessels are required to have at least one deep water release device on board.\n\nDemersal shelf rockfish are the following species: yelloweye, quillback, canary, China, copper, tiger, and rosethorn.\n\nPelagic rockfish species include black, dark, dusky, widow, and yellowtail.\n\nTrout and Dolly Varden fishing is good in rivers and lakes throughout July. It is often an overlooked fishery while anglers target salmon. With lighter tackle and abundant fish, anglers often find success. When fishing lakes, concentrate your efforts near the inlet and outlet, where fish tend to congregate. Early July is a good time to target these fish before pink salmon begin moving into freshwater.\n\nADF&G creel technicians are on the docks interviewing anglers, participation is important and only takes a couple of minutes. During an interview, creel samplers will ask a few short questions about your fishing trip and collect biological data from the fish harvested. The data collected through this program is essential for the sustainable management of sport fisheries, guiding management decisions to ensure fishing and harvest opportunities are maintained for the future.\n\nAn excellent resource for planning a trip is thegofishakinteractive map for Ketchikan which provides information on popular fishing locations, species run timing, fishing gear selections and boat and angler access."

Catches of king salmon in the Kanektok and Goodnews Rivers are reported to be good.\n\nThe Kuskokwim Bay rivers (Kanektok, Goodnews, Arolik) may be a good alternative to king fishing on the Kuskokwim river tributaries. The Kuskokwim Bay tributaries remain open at this time – but please check for any announcements prior to making plans.\n\nThe US Fish and Wildlife Service (Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge) has closed the harvest of king, chum and coho salmon to people that are not residents of the Kuskokwim River (but not currently the Kuskokwim Bay Rivers). Please contact their office in Bethel at(907) 543-3151for more information.\n\nSheefish are catchable at the mouths of many clearwater rivers such as the Aniak and Holitna Rivers, as well as other clearwater streams near Bethel such as the Kwethluk and Kisaralik Rivers. Large colorful spoons and spinners work well for these. Initially, high water levels have given way to more average levels and clarity which has contributed to better catchability.\n\nRainbow trout catches are currently reported as fair in both the sport fisheries and the subsistence rod-and-reel fisheries. These popular fisheries occur in the Kuskokwim Bay Rivers - Goodnews, Kanektok, and Arolik, and in the lower Kuskokwim drainages that include the Kisaralik, Kwethluk, Kasigluk, and Aniak Rivers. These are popular guided and outfitted fisheries in remote Alaska, with many private businesses that provide excellent services and opportunities.\n\nDolly Varden catches have been reported to be spotty to poor in many Kuskokwim River tributaries.\n\nNorthern pike fishing has been excellent with increasing water clarity as the high water conditions have decreased. Any clearwater mouth or connected slough complex along the mainstem Kuskokwim River affords excellent fishing. Anything that imitates prey and attracts attention will work. Crocodiles and larges spoons work anytime, and topwater lures such as jitterbugs and large fly patterns work best in late evening under the midnight sun when the large pike will lurk in the warm surface waters.\n\nPlease review theEmergency Orders and Advisory Announcementsbelow in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip:\n\nDuring these times of salmon conservation, it is important to use best practices when handling fish, especially if a fish is accidentally caught that is in a closed fishery. These practices include:\n\nEnjoy these western Alaska fishing opportunities, operate boats in courteous manner, pack out your waste and only leave your footprints. Good luck fishing!\n\nDon’t forget to bring your 2025 sport fishing license. You may purchase your sport fishing license online at theADF&G Online Store. Also, be sure to reviewEmergency Ordersand the2025 Northern Sport Fishing Regulations Summary Bookletfor the area you are fishing before you head out.\n\nFor more information, please call Kuskokwim-Goodnews Area Manager John Chythlook at(907) 459-7361."

Soon, egg-imitation lures and flies will become productive as salmon spawning commences. in rivers. North Slope rivers are running low and clear in most places and fishing for Arctic grayling should be good. Grayling fishing in North Slope lakes has also been productive.\n\nFishing for northern pike has been great as the water levels have dropped and fish have moved into off-channel habitats of the Pilgrim, Kuzitrin, Selawik, and Kobuk Rivers. Big spoons and soft baits work well for northern pike, as do large topwater lures and flies.\n\nFishing for Arctic char and lake trout in North Slope lakes has been good but the lake trout and Arctic char will move into deeper water as the temperatures rise during mid-day. Fishing effort for burbot has historically been low in the Northwest and the North Slope Management Areas (NW/NSMA) but large fish can be found in many North Slope rivers and lakes. These are almost exclusively caught with cut bait fished on the bottom.\n\nSheefish have begun their upstream migration to spawning grounds in the Kobuk and Selawik Rivers, and fish have been caught near the Kobuk River villages of Selawik and Kobuk. Spawning generally occurs in late-September, just before freeze-up.\n\nSpawning runs of Dolly Varden have begun upstream migration in Northwestern and North Slope rivers, and fish will trickle in through August. The Noatak and Wulik Rivers are the most popular spots for large Dolly Varden, with fish over 12 pounds possible in both drainages.\n\nPlease review theEmergency Orders and Advisory Announcementsbelow in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip:\n\nCall Northwest and North Slope Area Management Biologist Brendan Scanlon at (907) 459-7268."

Catches of king salmon in the Kanektok and Goodnews Rivers are reported to be good.\n\nThe Kuskokwim Bay rivers (Kanektok, Goodnews, Arolik) may be a good alternative to king fishing on the Kuskokwim river tributaries. The Kuskokwim Bay tributaries remain open at this time – but please check for any announcements prior to making plans.\n\nThe US Fish and Wildlife Service (Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge) has closed the harvest of king, chum and coho salmon to people that are not residents of the Kuskokwim River (but not currently the Kuskokwim Bay Rivers). Please contact their office in Bethel at(907) 543-3151for more information.\n\nSheefish are catchable at the mouths of many clearwater rivers such as the Aniak and Holitna Rivers, as well as other clearwater streams near Bethel such as the Kwethluk and Kisaralik Rivers. Large colorful spoons and spinners work well for these. Initially, high water levels have given way to more average levels and clarity which has contributed to better catchability.\n\nRainbow trout catches are currently reported as fair in both the sport fisheries and the subsistence rod-and-reel fisheries. These popular fisheries occur in the Kuskokwim Bay Rivers - Goodnews, Kanektok, and Arolik, and in the lower Kuskokwim drainages that include the Kisaralik, Kwethluk, Kasigluk, and Aniak Rivers. These are popular guided and outfitted fisheries in remote Alaska, with many private businesses that provide excellent services and opportunities.\n\nDolly Varden catches have been reported to be spotty to poor in many Kuskokwim River tributaries.\n\nNorthern pike fishing has been excellent with increasing water clarity as the high water conditions have decreased. Any clearwater mouth or connected slough complex along the mainstem Kuskokwim River affords excellent fishing. Anything that imitates prey and attracts attention will work. Crocodiles and larges spoons work anytime, and topwater lures such as jitterbugs and large fly patterns work best in late evening under the midnight sun when the large pike will lurk in the warm surface waters.\n\nPlease review theEmergency Orders and Advisory Announcementsbelow in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip:\n\nDuring these times of salmon conservation, it is important to use best practices when handling fish, especially if a fish is accidentally caught that is in a closed fishery. These practices include:\n\nEnjoy these western Alaska fishing opportunities, operate boats in courteous manner, pack out your waste and only leave your footprints. Good luck fishing!\n\nDon’t forget to bring your 2025 sport fishing license. You may purchase your sport fishing license online at theADF&G Online Store. Also, be sure to reviewEmergency Ordersand the2025 Northern Sport Fishing Regulations Summary Bookletfor the area you are fishing before you head out.\n\nFor more information, please call Kuskokwim-Goodnews Area Manager John Chythlook at(907) 459-7361."

The Dalton Highway begins at MP 73 on the Elliott Highway. Currently road conditions for the Steese, Dalton, and Taylor Highways are rated fair, but before driving these, check the current road conditions atAlaska 511for the latest updates. Also, be aware the first 60 miles of the Taylor Highway are paved, and the remaining sections are gravel. Recent rainfall has helped dampen down some of the fires and cleared smoke out the air. However, sunny days with forecasted thunderstorms can cause these fires to erupt again and/or create new fire activity. A good source for recent wildfire and smoke activity is atUAFSMOKE. Be careful with any fire sources when fishing and camping during hot, dry, and windy conditions.\n\nNorthern pike, like Arctic grayling, are fairly ubiquitous throughout the Yukon River drainage.\n\nPlease review theEmergency Orders and Advisory Announcementsbelow in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip:\n\nYou can purchase your fishing license through theADF&G Online Storee.
