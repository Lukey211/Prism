    "full_text": "Recent Emergency Orders & Press Releases for Petersburg\n\nThe steelhead fishing season is happening and anglers are reporting good early catches. This could be due to an earlier than normal season or simply a sign of a strong season that spans a larger timeframe. Currently the creeks are low and we could use some rain. Still, while the water is cold and there’s sun in the forecast I encourage you to get outside and head to your favorite creek. As the water warms slightly you might expect the fishing to get even better. We are entering the best three weeks starting now.\n\nDolly Varden and trout will become more aggressive chasing your bait as the ice comes off the lakes and the water temperatures start to rise. Dolly Varden and trout are found in many places in the streams and are likely to bite while stripping line or running a jig through a hole with a spinning rod. Other observations include emerging juvenile salmon, which Dolly Varden will be feeding upon.\n\nThe vast majority of marine waters in the Petersburg/Wrangell area are currently closed to king salmon retention. Opportunity to harvest king salmon will be available in areas where Alaska hatchery produced king salmon will be returning beginning June 1, 2024. Advisory Announcements for individual hatcheries are available onour website. Remember that a king salmon stamp is required whenever fishing for king salmon (including catch and release).\n\nHalibut can be targeted this time of year and anglers have reported some recent success. The sport fishery is open February 1 – December 31, 2024. Reminder:Filleting halibut: No person shall possess on board a vessel, including charter vessels and pleasure craft used for fishing, halibut that have been filleted, mutilated, or otherwise disfigured in any manner, except that each halibut may be cut into no more than 2 ventral pieces, 2 dorsal pieces, and 2 cheek pieces, with enough skin on each piece to identify whether the piece is from the light side or the dark side of the fish.\n\nSport fishing for lingcod is currently closed in all Southeast Alaska waters but will open on May 16. Nonresident bag and possession limits have changed since last year. Limits: 1 per day, 1 in possession; 30-35 inches or 55 inches and longer. There is an annual limit of 2 fish, 1 of which is 30-35 inches in length, and 1 that is 55 inches or greater in length, harvest record is required. Alaskan Resident bag and possession remain – 1 daily, 2 in possession, no size limit.\n\nRockfish regulations have remained in place since the last fishing season. Pelagic rockfish regulations remain the same with a daily bag limit of 5 and possession limit of 10 in the Petersburg, Wrangell, and Kake area. Slope and demersal shelf rockfish species both have a daily bag limit of one fish and possession limit of 2 for Alaska residents. Demersal shelf rockfish are closed to retention for nonresidents anglers and yelloweye are closed to retention for all anglers. A helpful species identification guide has been published on theADFG website. Anglers are reminded that a rockfish release device is now required to be used whenever releasing rockfish and a rockfish release device must be onboard your vessel whenever sport fishing in marine waters."

Since these are hatchery produced king salmon, not wild stock, opportunity exist for both resident and nonresident anglers to harvest bag limits of 2 kings 28 inches or greater in length and 2 kings under 28 inches in the specific area of the saltwater portion of the THA. For a nonresident, this does not apply to your annual king salmon limit. The freshwater portion of the THA, Blind Slough, is closed June 1stthrough July 31stthis summer. The reason behind the closure is a small amount of forecasted adult returns to the THA and following the management plan that protects the freshwater kings first as they are most vulnerable to stress in the final stretch leading back to the hatchery.\n\nAnita Bay opened near Wrangell on June 1st. Resident anglers are allowed a bag limit of 2 king salmon 28 inches or greater in length and nonresident anglers are allowed a bag limit of 1 king salmon 28 inches or greater in length. For a nonresident, this does apply to your annual king salmon limit.\n\nGunnuk Creek opened near Kake on June 1st. Resident anglers are allowed a bag limit of 2 king salmon 28 inches or greater in length and nonresident anglers are allowed a bag limit of 1 king salmon 28 inches or greater in length. For a nonresident, this does apply to your annual king salmon limit.\n\nThe following king salmon angling areas open soon:\n\nOn June 15thCity Creek near Petersburg will open. Bag and possession limit (all anglers) is one king salmon any size. For a nonresident, this does apply to your annual king salmon limit.\n\nOn June 15th,with the exception ofDistrict 8 and a portion of Eastern Passage near Wrangell, all remaining areas are open to king salmon fishing.

With lighter tackle, the late spring and early summer offer a good time to seek these fish without having to deal with pink salmon in the streams. Reports are that there are plenty of trout and Dolly Varden to be caught in the streams. Remember to check the bag and size limits of trout in our Sport Fishing Regulations Summary as they do change depending on which stream you are fishing.\n\nLingcod\n\nLimits: 1 per day, 1 in possession; 30-35 inches or 55 inches and longer.

The majority of marine waters in the Petersburg/Wrangell area are open to king salmon retention by June 15th. The exception to that are waters adjacent to the Stikine River which will not open until July 15th. King salmon regulations have changed since last year. We have a separate set of regulations for the Blind Slough/Wrangell Narrows Terminal Harvest Area, Anita Bay, Gunnuk Creek, City Creek and the remainder of the region. Please see the Advisory Announcement onour websitefor maps and more specific information about each of these locations. Remember that a king salmon stamp is required whenever fishing for king salmon (including catch and release).\n\nHalibut\n\nHalibut are a hard fighting and delicious species to target right now. If looking for halibut locations, target high points under the water that come up to as shallow 80-100 feet. Large halibut can be at 300 feet or greater. Halibut catch rates should increase as they come into shallow waters over the summer. Traditional fishing areas such as The Eye Opener in Sumner Strait, Level Island, or north of Petersburg in Frederick Sound hold the most promise. Anglers can fish the slack tides with heavy duty gear using either whole or cut herring for bait\n\nThe Halibut sport fishery is open February 1 – December 31, 2025. Reminder: Filleting halibut: No person shall possess on board a vessel, including charter vessels and pleasure craft used for fishing, halibut that have been filleted, mutilated, or otherwise disfigured in any manner, except that each halibut may be cut into no more than 2 ventral pieces, 2 dorsal pieces, and 2 cheek pieces, with enough skin on each piece to identify whether the piece is from the light side or the dark side of the fish.\n\nLingcod\n\nResidents are allowed a daily bag limit of 1; 2 in possession. Nonresidents are allowed a daily bag limit of 1; 1 in possession; 30-35 inches or 55 inches and longer. There is an annual limit of 2 fish, 1 of which is 30-35 inches in length, and 1 that is 55 inches or greater in length. A harvest record is required. The Northern Southeast Area will be closed to nonresidents for lingcod fishing from June 15 - August 15, 2025.\n\nRockfish\n\nRockfish regulations have changed since the last fishing season. The retention of demersal shelf rockfish, including yelloweye, is open for residents of Alaska with a daily bag limit of 1; 2 in possession. Demersal shelf rockfish, including yelloweye, will be open for nonresidents from July 1 through August 25 with an annual limit of 1 fish. Slope Rockfish are open to resident and nonresidents with a daily bag limit of 1; 1 in possession. Pelagic Rockfish are open to resident and nonresidents with a daily bag limit of 3; 6 in possession.

Anglers are reminded that a rockfish release device is now required to be used whenever releasing rockfish and a rockfish release device must be onboard your vessel whenever sport fishing in marine waters.\n\nDolly Varden and Trout\n\nDolly Varden and trout season are abundant throughout the creeks. Often overlooked by anglers with their sites on salmon, these smaller fish can offer plenty of fun on lighter tackle. June offers a good time to seek these fish without having to deal with pink salmon in the streams.\n\nThese fish can also be found in salt or brackish water estuaries, for example Blind Slough, Petersburg Creek, around most of the city docks, and in Wrangell Narrows along North Nordic Drive. Resident cutthroat and Dolly Varden can also be found in area streams and lakes accessed by the Petersburg and Wrangell Road systems.\n\nCreel Samplers\n\nAlaska Department of Fish and Game creel samplers have been on the public docks since mid-May approaching anglers to ask about their catch.

Large halibut tend to be at 300 feet or greater, try to fish the slack tides with heavy duty gear and use whole herring for bait. If you are in Petersburg fishing from a small skiff and need to stay close to town, fish just south of the red buoy just outside of Wrangell Narrows in 300 to 400 feet of water.\n\nThe Halibut sport fishery is open February 1 – December 31, 2025.

Charter operators and business owners, registeronlineor in person for your 2024 elogbook.\n\nThe warm weather has brought lots of boats out of hibernation for the summer. Some anglers have reported good luck with kings. The creel season just started this week, so there isn’t yet any available catch-per-effort data, however anecdotally, many anglers have had success for kings particularly at Vitskari Rocks. Like the last couple of years, there are several reports of small kings being caught. Fishing for kings should get better through the next couple of months. Other salmon will move inshore later in the season as the weather warms.\n\nSteelhead season is here and the peak run timing for many systems around the Sitka Area is the first and second week of May. Initial surveys of steelhead streams around the region have shown typical numbers of fish. The water is a bit warmer than usual which may shift run timing just a few days earlier.\n\nFishing for Dollies can also be good this time of year. Often schools of dollies are attracted to out-migrating salmon fry (this peaks in the next few weeks). Look for them in saltwater near the mouths of creeks and sometimes even up in the streams a ways. Smolt or fry patterns work well for them. All of the streams in the Sitka Area have at least a small population of Dolly Varden.\n\nFishing for halibut is open. Fishing for halibut is good and stays relatively consistent through the summer.

    "full_text": "Recent Emergency Orders & Press Releases for Yakutat\n\nWelcome to the 2024 Yakutat fishing report. Lets talk about the only game in town, steelhead. What are the highlights entering the 2024 steelhead season? Well, the first noiticable thing is the lack of snow pack. In recent seasons prior, there is typically a healthy layer of snow across the river banks and along the trails making it difficult getting around by foot. That is definitely not the case this year. Staff was able to easily access fishing locations above the 9-mile bridge this past weekend. So walking conditions are excellent on land in that regard. However, its never always that easy. A large number of trees have fallen during the winter due to high winds and have blocked some of the trails along the river so anglers will need to do some bush-whacking. And wading the river above 9-mile is still challenging due to more trees falling across the river. More fishing holes it seems have either been blocked by trees or have filled in due to high flows pushing gravel into them. Its challenging to find good fishing locations up high is the take home.\n\nWater conditions on the Situk are excellent right now for walking and wading. The current water level on the Situk River is 276 cfs/in, which is close to prime for fishing and is excellent for wading. Boat travel is also good at these levels. Water temperatures are decent as well, with temps similar to those seen the previous two years. Adding all the environmental cues together one could surmise this sets up for slightly earlier run-timing or at least average run-timing.\n\nSo with regards to run-timing, what are we seeing in fish numbers so far? Well, there are some fish that have moved downstream from the lake earlier than we've seen in the previous few years. Staff observed fish spread throughout the upper section of the Situk above 9-mile Bridge. Reports have also been confirmed that there are some lake fish below 9-mile Bridge earlier than the previous few years. The Lower Situk river has been sparse in terms of reports and angling effort, so we don't have much information from down low. With water conditions and terrestrial conditions how they are currently and with the chilly weather that has persisited in the last week or more, I would guess run-timing to be average to maybe a slightly more earlier run. That means fresh spring run fish should start entering in good numbers down low around the 3rd week of April and end around the middle of May.\n\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters. The staff has received no reports of sport fishing out in Yakutat Bay. Most anglers troll spoons or herring behind a flasher.\n\nHalibut fishing is slow.\n\nLingcod fishing is closed until May 16th.\n\nFishing for rockfish should be excellent in the Yakutat area.\n\nFor further information, please get in touch with the Yakutat Area Sport Fish management biologist Jason Pawluk at(907) 784-3222."

Fishing for halibut should be peaking over the next couple of months.\n\nLingcod fishing is excellent in the Yakutat area. Lingcod are spread out throughout the area but like to hang out near rocky structures or pinnacles. Typically using herring as bait, or using any type of jig will work.\n\nFishing for rockfish should be excellent in the Yakutat area. Try using small dart jigs near shallow rocky structures.\n\nFor further information, please get in touch with the Yakutat Area Sport Fish management biologist Jason Pawluk at(907) 784-3222."

But pickets were put back in on Wednesday and counting has resumed. As expected, the high waters from the rains pushed fish upstream and basically cleared out the lower and middle river of fish. So as a result of that fishing will be difficult over the next week or so. Fishing should be better in the lower section of river as fish start to refill that section as they work their way upstream. Expect to see other species soon such as pink salmon and a few coho mixed in with the sockeye. So far over 40,000 sockeye have passed the weir. Water levels are a little high still but should be fishable for sockeye over the next week or more. Boaters should have better access to the fish which may be spread out more.\n\nThe daily bag and possession limits of sockeye salmon on the Situk River were liberalized to six fish a day and twelve fish in possession, effective Thursday, July 11th.\n\nSituk River Sockeye Salmon Bag Limit Increase Announcement\n\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters. Fishing has slowed a little since the last report with more anglers targeting groundfish. Fishing continues to be slow and spotty inside the islands, with Monti Bay and Ocean Cape producing better catch rates. Most anglers troll spoons or herring behind a flasher.\n\nHalibut fishing has slowed some with more smaller fish being caught. Anglers are having a harder time finding sizable fish, and based on angler reports, dogfish have flooded into the area making fishing extremely difficult. Advice for avoiding dogfish include ceasing the use of chumbags, moving frequently, and taking breaks between soaking bait to try and clear them out. For halibut, try sitting on anchor while using herring, salmon carcasses, or squid/octopus for bait, or try drifting with jigs baited with herring or unbaited.

Based on the amount of rain we've had, discharge rates are most likely above 450 cfs which makes it pretty difficult to wade fish and cross the river.

It's basically been raining/sleeting/snowing since April 5th and both air and water temperatures remain very cool. That being said, fishing reports have been decent with some nice fish being caught. The issue at hand currently is water levels are so high that only boat anglers are enjoying the spoils as levels are currently too high for wading anglers. Unfortunately the river gauging station is still not functioning and we are left in the dark as to having some sort of index or measure of where exactly water levels are at currently. One thing is for certain though, the last reading of 477cfs at 730am yesterday combined with over 2.5\" of rain falling in the last 28 hours, produce water levels that are too high for river crossing and should remain that way for the next few days. Anglers should take extreme caution when fishing by foot and not attempt to cross the river until levels drop significantly. Boat anglers will have the most success in dealing with the higher water levels and in turn be able to get to the fish better than shore anglers. The extended forecast calls for less rain so hopefully conditions will imporve for shore anglers by Monday or Tuesday of next week.\n\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters.

The good news is for now we have a functioning river gauging station. It came online last night and we are currently sitting at 485 cfs, which is bordering on doable wade fishing conditions (450 cfs). It looks like we have some decent weather for the next few days and that will lead to a drop in water levels, so for the immediate future it looks like good conditions all around. Rain is forecast starting Sunday through most of next week so it will be short-lived. Fishing reports continue to be decent with some really nice fish being caught. Fish moved upstream with our recent high water so the majority of fish are in the upper river spawning. Some fresh fish continue to enter the lower river but will most likely be moving upstream at a faster clip with the water levels we have. Run-timing seems to be a little on the early side based on environmental conditions so we may be at the peak or slightly past it. Either way fishing is good right now, the weather not so much. Enjoy these next few days while you can before the next rain events start on Sunday.\n\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters. Department staff received their first sport fishing report for saltwater king salmon fishing. There are a few kings being caught back inside Yakutat Bay when you can get away from all the herring in Monti Bay. Most anglers troll spoons or herring behind a flasher.

Lots of precipitation and cold conditions are persisting. Water levels from this last storm have current water levels sitting at unfishable levels if you are trying to wade fish by foot. We are currently sitting at 629 cfs, which is above doable wade fishing conditions (450 cfs). Rain is forecast to continue today and tomorrow before a small break and then another storm Sunday and Monday. Weather starts to look decent starting on Wednesday of next week with precipitation amounts dropping significantly. Boat anglers will be unaffected by the higher water levels and in fact will probably benefit from it in terms of reaching and not spooking fish. Fishing reports have been spotty lately with anglers hitting fish one day, and then nothing the next. Staff and AWT troopers touched up the upper river spawning closure markers and contacted sport anglers on their way out. There are alot of dark fall run/lake fish that are currently spawning in the upper reaches. The bite is off for the most part up there. Fresh fish however are entering the lower river and provide a good chance for hooking up given spawning fish are off the bite. Numbers of fresh fish appear to be decent but not sure about timing yet. If the cooler weather has any effect, then we could be seeing later run-timing for the spring component which would have them coming in good right about now. We'll see.\n\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters. More sport fishing reports for saltwater king salmon fishing have come in over the past week. There are a few kings being caught back inside Yakutat Bay at locations such as logdump, Johnstone Pass, and Monti Bay. Herring have still been seen spawning in locations such as Puget Cove and Point Turner, but for the most part have vacated the area. Most anglers troll spoons or herring behind a flasher.

Since April 5th, 24.49\" of precipitation has fallen in Yakutat, when on average only 9.90\" of rain usually falls. Last week saw water levels rise again with all the rain we had maintaining the difficult wading conditions. Currently the gauge has the Situk at 549 cfs, which is way better than where we've been for awhile. And, there's no rain today so levels are dropping. Forecast looks better than what its been doing here the last month. There are some showers in the near and long-term forecast but no significant rain events until maybe Monday night. Boat anglers have continued to do decent while fishing this last week, but it has been spotty. Shore based anglers have also been getting into a few fish above the bridge with fresh spring entry fish making it up into that neck of the river. Overall, fishing should be winding down here soon, just as water levels are getting back to normal.\n\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters.

Weather continues to be a factor, or deterrant, however you want to look at it. We continue to get rain storm after rain storm here in Yakutat this spring/summer and its made sport fishing in freshwaters pretty difficult. Situk water level is currently between storms at 329cfs at the time of this writing. The forecast calls for another major storm to roll through starting tomorrow and last through Sunday. Water levels will undoubtedly rise above 600 cfs making shore fishing almost impossible down low where the sockeye are holding. Things look to improve starting next week when weather seems to calm down a bit for possibly an extended period of time. We finally saw a push of sockeye go through the weir last night when over 3,800 fish passed. More fish are holding downstream but will most likely move up with this next storm.

The river peaked in discharge late Sunday evening around ~1,700 cfs. Water levels over 600 cfs pretty much make wade fishing impossible, so fishing has been put on hold since Saturday. One of the other casualties of the high water this weekend was the weir, which blew out sometime late Sunday night. As a result there have been no fish counts for almost six days. Prior to the weir washing out, the crew had passed over 5,000 sockeye in two days with more behind it. It was starting to look like another good run. The good news is that water levels are dropping, and knock on wood (hold on, let me do it.....there), the long-term forecast is looking good with a possible shift into the correct weather pattern for this time of year. Currently the water discharge is at ~500 cfs and dropping. Water should continue to drop and fishing conditions should be good for the foreseeable future.

    "full_text": "Recent Emergency Orders & Press Releases for Yakutat\n\nSockeye fishing has been good over the last week on the Situk River. Water levels are at normal and has made fishing quite good. The weir is back up and running and counts are projecting a good run so far. The long term forecast calls for rain so weather isn't looking too hot, but the rain levels shouldn't be enough to push anglers off the river this time around. Fishing should be good for the next few weeks. The Situk River within 50 yards of both upstream/downstream of the 9-mile Bridge is closed to sport fishing.\n\nDolly fishing should be excellent. Large numbers of Dolly Varden are present in the Situk River and other freshwaters in the Yakutat management area. They are feasting on emigrating pink salmon fry, and salmon smolt. Almost any lure or fly can be used to catch them. Try mimicking salmon smolt or fry when choosing a lure.\n\nCutthroat trout fishing continues to be excellent right now. The best location to target them is Tawah Creek. The Tawah Creek within 50 yards of both upstream/downstream of the Cannon Beach Road Bridge is closed to sport fishing. They are spread throughout the drainage and are similar to Dolly Varden in that you can use a variety of lures or flies to target them.\n\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters. Fishing for kings this last week was pretty slow in most places. The hot spot this last week definetly was Monti Bay in locations like Point Turner, Point Munoz, and Point Carrew. Regular drags inside the islands were pretty devoid of fish this last week. Most anglers troll spoons or herring behind a flasher. Please check the department website below for the recent emergency order and advisory announcements regarding 2025 regional king salmon regulations for Southeast Alaska.\n\nHalibut fishing was excellent this last week with regards to weather and nice fish being caught. The weather has allowed anglers to get out to wherever they want to this last week, with most anglers going out front of Yakutat Bay. Catches were good early, but slowed some around the area around Buoy #2. Sounds like anglers are moving around to find bigger halibut to such places as Point Mambi and in the back of Yakutat Bay. The forecast looks decent this next week, but there are a few wind events so the seas will be a little lumpier than last week for sure but still doable. Anglers are anchoring up and soaking herring/octopus/salmon heads on circle hooks or using baited jigs as they drift.\n\nLingcod fishing is open in the Yakutat area.Fishing has been excellent so far. Please check the department website for the recent emergency order and advisory annoucements regarding changes to lingcod regulations in the Yakutat management area.

Spring Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout fishing in the estuaries is just beginning, steelhead can be caught and released in area streams (other than Peterson Creek, which is closed) and crabbing for Dungeness and Tanner crab is still good.\n\nAlthough the harvesting of king salmon is currently closed in the immediate waters around Juneau, there are certainly opportunities coming up soon. The hatchery area will open June 1 and the rest of the marine waters will open June 15. When these areas open, Juneau shoreside anglers can cast large spoons or small herring at locations such as False Outer Point (June 1), Tee Harbor (June 15), and the Breadline (June 15) for king salmon. Marine boat anglers looking togo king salmon fishing in the Juneau area should troll using flashers, spoons, or herring rigs in Fritz Cove, Auke Bay or Lena Cove. Here are somerecommendations on king salmon tackle and gear set-upsfor both shoreside and marine boat anglers. More ambitious marine boat anglers looking to enjoy the nicer weather and harvest a king salmon before June 1 can do so under regionwide regulations by venturing west of Lemesurier Island in Icy Strait. Just be sure to file a float plan with someone before you leave and be prepared to play cards or cribbage in a safe anchorage if you have to wait for the weather to improve.\n\nAlaskan resident:\n\nNonresident:\n\nThe Southeast regionwide bag and possession limits above will apply in all areasexcept as modifiedbelow for the inside watersin the vicinity of Juneau:\n\nMarine waters near Juneau except Seymour Canal and upper Taku Inlet:(The waters of District 9 north of a line from Patterson Pt. to Pt. Ellis, District 10, Sections 11-A, 11-B, 11-C, District 12, Portion of Section 13-C southeast of a line between Nismeni Pt. and a point on the Chichagof Island shoreline at 57° 35.59' N. lat., 135° 22.33' W. long., Sections 14-B and 14-C, and District 15 south of the latitude of Sherman Rock;see map below)\n\nIn the waters adjacent to the Taku River:(Taku Inlet north of a line from Point Bishop to Point Greely,see map below)\n\nIn the waters adjacent to the King Salmon River: (Section 11-D, Seymour Canal north of 57° 37' N. latitude,see map below)\n\nTake a moment to view the Hatchery King Salmon Regulations map below opening June 1. Please note the closed area in Gastineau Channel. This closure is necessary because the projected return is low and we need as many kings back to the fish ladder as possible to help with future production.\n\nWithin the designated saltwater hatchery sport harvest area consisting of the contiguous waters of Stephens Passage, Auke Bay, Fritz Cove and Gastineau Channel, enclosed on the west by a line running from the tip of Point Louisa to the navigational aid at the northern tip of Portland Island (58o21.13’N., 134o45.52’W) then along the eastern shore of Portland Island to its most southern point and ending on Douglas Island at the northern tip of Outer Point, and enclosed on the east by a line extending from the Salmon Creek Bridge to a regulatory marker on the Douglas shore and all salt waters of Lena Cove south of a line from Pt. Lena to a regulatory marker on the mainland shore located at 58o24.20’N. lat.,134o45.64’W. long.\n\n(DIPAC) is closed to snagging and king salmon fishing. Snagging is prohibited and king salmon may not be targeted or retained. Any king salmon caught must be released immediately.\n\nKing salmonmay notbe targeted or retained and isclosedto king salmon fishing. Any king salmon caught must be released immediately from the salmon creek bridge to the ADF&G marker ¼ mile south of Dupont Dock.\n\nAnglers are reminded that the daily bag and possession limit for king salmon in all freshwaters crossed by the Juneau road system including Fish Creek and Fish Creek Pond are 4 fish, any size and any king salmon harvested by non-residents do not count toward their annual limit. Please note that within Fish Creek Pond, from June 1 - August 31, anglers may use bait, may snag, and may use weighted hooks, lures, and treble hooks with a gap greater than ½ inch between the point and shank. However,in Fish Creek itself, anglers may NOT usebait, or snag, or use the aforementioned large treble hooks. The marine waters at the mouth of Fish Creek fall under the Terminal Hatchery Area (THA) regulations, and snagging is allowed in salt waters.\n\nTill the end of May, anadromous Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout will begin to move into saltwater and will congregate at the mouths of local creeks to feed on emigrating salmon fry and smolts. In particular, Dolly Varden will gather at creek mouths along Gastineau Channel such as Salmon Creek and Sheep Creek, while cutthroat trout will group together at the mouths of Cowee Creek, Fish Creek, and Montana Creek. Using small smolt imitation fly patterns or small spinners and spoons is the best way to catch these fish.\n\nThere will also be some fish that do not leave their \"overwintering\" sites and head for the ocean. Known as \"residents\", these fish stay in their home lake, pond, or stream the entire year. While these fish may move around in the system to take advantage of food or environmental conditions, they will be present for your fishing all year. Windfall Lake and the Dredge Lakes area are the best locations to find resident Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout.\n\nIn all drainages crossed by the Juneau road system, as well as the saltwater adjacent to the Juneau road system to a line ¼ mile offshore, cutthroat and rainbow trout bag limits (in combination) are 2 daily, 2 in possession with a 14-inch minimum and 22-inch maximum size limit. Dolly Varden limits are 2 daily, 2 in possession, no size limit. Anglers should check the 2023Southeast Alaska Sportfish Regulation Summaryfor special regulations specific to the stream or lake they intend to fish.\n\nSteelhead adults will soon begin returning to their natal streams to spawn. On the Juneau road system, Montana Creek and especially Cowee Creek, are the best locations to find steelhead. In Southeast Alaska, most streams that contain steelhead have small annual returns (in the hundreds) and thus can be vulnerable to over-fishing.Retention of steelhead in the Juneau area is prohibited. Any steelhead caught in a drainage crossed by the Juneau road system must be released immediately. Current regionwide regulations elsewhere, away from the road system, prohibit any steelhead under 36\" from being harvested and require that a harvest record be completed in ink immediately upon landing a steelhead that is to be harvested. Keep in mind that all fish should be treated with great care regardless of size to ensure the best chances for survival upon release. Please keep fish in the water while releasing. Our website has moreadvice on proper catch-and-release methods.\n\nAnglers should note thatall sport fishing in Peterson Creek from the falls to the intertidal waters within a 200-yard radius of the creek mouth at saltwater is CLOSED April 1-June 30to protect spawning steelhead. The Advisory Announcement can be foundhereand is provided below.\n\nA portion of Peterson Creek, north of Juneau, is closed to sport fishing for all species. Specific restrictions are as follows:\n\nBased on snorkel survey expansions, in years when concurrent weir counts were available, overall production of steelhead in Peterson Creek has declined in recent years. For the last 9 years (2015–2023), snorkel survey index counts conducted each spring have been below the 1997–2014 average of 28 (equivalent to about 116 fish), when steelhead abundance in the creek appeared to be relatively stable. In 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 the snorkel survey counts were 6, 3, 11, 24, 18, and 27 fish, respectively. A conservative approach is necessary to manage the Peterson Creek steelhead stock during this period of very low escapements.\n\nFor more information, please call the Division of Sport Fish Region 1 office in Douglas at907-465-4270.\n\nExcept for red and blue king crab, other shellfish are currently available to harvest.Personal use red and blue king crab fishing is currently closed(beginning April 1), to protect molting and mating crab, but will reopen July 1.\n\nPersonal use king crab fishing is only open to Alaskan residents. A sport fishing license and a Southeast Alaska Regional Personal Use King Crab Permit are required. These are available atthe ADF&G online store. Please check for Personal UseEmergency Orders, legal-size and pot configurations, and restrictions online.Section 11-A is currently CLOSED to Alaskan resident PU king crab fishing. Stay tuned for the Juneau area PU announcement later this year using the link above. Harvest must bereported online. Please check the 2024 Southeast Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary bookletpages 33-36for regulations specific to shellfish.\n\nFor Alaskan residents in the Juneau area, licensed anglers can keep 20 Dungeness males, a 6.5\" minimum width. While taking Dungeness crab, 5 pots or 10 rings per person may be used, with a max of 10 pots or 20 rings per vessel. While taking Tanner crab, no more than 4 pots or 10 rings per vessel may be used. In total, no more than 5 pots per person and 10 pots per vessel may be used for taking shellfish regardless of pot type.\n\nFor nonresidents in the Juneau area, licensed anglers can keep 3 male Tanner and Dungeness crab (in combination). Tanner males need to be 5.5\" minimum width and Dungeness males need to be 6.5\" minimum width.\n\nSport and personal use shrimp fisheries in the Juneau and Tenakee area will remain CLOSEDuntil further notice. The closed area consists of all marine waters of Section 11-A north and west of a line extending from a regulatory marker near point Bishop to the Coast Guard marker and light on Point Arden, extending to a line at the latitude of Little Island light, and east of a line from Little Island light to Point Retreat light. And the Tenakee closed area consists of all marine waters in Tenakee Inlet west of the longitude of Corner Point at 135° 06.50' W long. Check theSport and Personal Use Advisory Announcement,\n\nOutside the Juneau 11-A and Tenakee Inlet areas, sport and personal use shrimp fishing remains open. Sport and personal use shrimpers who have a valid sport fishing license must also have a free shrimp permit available on theADF&G online store. Participating anglers must sign their permit in ink to make it valid and have the permit in possession while taking shrimp in Southeast Alaska. Shrimp limits and gear requirements for sport and personal use shrimp fishing cab be found onpages 33-36of the 2024 Southeast Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary.Reportingof effort and harvest is required and must be submitted to the department even if you did not fish.\n\nEvery fall/winter season, the Douglas office gets questions about harvesting clams in the Juneau area. ADF&G does not recommend harvesting clams from any waters in the Juneau area due to the possibility that the clams may contain Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) toxins. Currently, no beaches in the Juneau area are monitored on a regular basis (i.e- \"certified\") for PSP toxins. If you harvest, you do so at your own risk of PSP poisoning. Sporadic sampling has been conducted by theSoutheast Alaska Tribal Ocean Research (SEATOR)project, but clams of any species and at any time during the year may still contain toxic levels of PSP. Please navigate to the followingDepartment of Environmental Conservation (DEC) web pagefor more information about PSP.\n\nNEW!Check out thewefishakpage on the ADF&G website for the newJuneau-Glacier Bay Interactive Mapto discover popular fishing locations and information on species run timing, fishing gear selections, and boat and angler access tips thru the Sport Fishgofishak application."

    "full_text": "Recent Emergency Orders & Press Releases for Juneau\n\nOver the last few weeks king salmon fishing has been extremely slow but other salmonid catch numbers have been tracking similarly to last year’s creel census. There seem to be a lot of chum salmon around indicating an early or very strong return on chums to the Juneau area. Unfortunately, the Chinook salmon return to the hatchery has been poor and broodstock goals are not likely to be achieved. The terminal harvest areas of Auke Bay, Fritz Cove, and the Gastineau Channel will be closed to king salmon fishing from June 24 – August 31. Lena Cove will remain open unless otherwise specified in a future advisory announcement. Be sure to check thisadvisory announcement.\n\nStill too early for coho, but some Chinook chum, and pink salmon are making their way through the terminal harvest zones where the rest of the marine waters opened Saturday June 15 for king salmon. Marine boat anglers looking togo king salmon fishing in the Juneau area should troll using flashers, spoons, or herring rigs on the backside of Douglas, Point Retreat and Shelter Island. Here are somerecommendations on king salmon tackle and gear set-upsfor both shoreside and marine boat anglers. Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout can still be caught in estuaries and mouth of creeks.\n\nHalibut are steadily returning to shallower marine waters as summer comes upon us. There has been some good luck for halibut fishing in the typical hotspots such as the North Shelter-Lincoln Island areas. Remember to check in on your regulations forcharter (guided)vsunguided halibutfishing regulations.\n\nWith nicer weather comes more effort and fishing opportunities. And that certainly shines true with rockfish.

Since its inception in 1947, this cherished summer fishing event has brought together people of all ages and backgrounds for a weekend of fun and community spirit. Whether you're an avid angler or just looking to support a great cause, join in the quest for king and coho salmon.\n\nRemember to purchase your derby ticket to participate—tickets are available at DeHart's, Sportsman's Warehouse, or Western Auto Marine. Join for a fantastic weekend of fishing and camaraderie!\n\nOver the past few weeks, coho salmon activity has shown a steady increase. Anglers are finding success near North Shelter and Lincoln Island, Pt. Retreat, Funter Bay, and the backside of Douglas Island. While catches have been lighter off the Breadline, St. James Bay, and south Shelter Island, there are still opportunities to enjoy a successful outing throughout the region. Although Chinook salmon harvest has decreased, anglers are still reeling in a few kings off the backside of Douglas Island, and around Benjamin Island.\n\nMost chum salmon have now returned to freshwater habitats, and very few are still being caught in saltwater. As they transition, their distinctive calico markings are becoming increasingly prominent. This year’s chum salmon run has been exceptionally strong, resulting in numerous freshwater streams being densely populated with spawning fish. We’re also observing scattered groups of pink salmon around Pt. Retreat, as well as near North Shelter, Lincoln Island, the Breadline, Funter Bay and the backside of Douglas Island.\n\nMarine boat anglers looking to go king salmon fishing in the Juneau area could troll using flashers, spoons, or herring rigs. Here are somerecommendations on king salmon tackle and gear set-upsfor both shoreside and marine boat anglers.\n\nPlease take a moment to view the Hatchery King Salmon Regulations map below. The area has been closed since June 24th. This closure is necessary to protect broodstock required for future production. The closures in the hatchery area will aid in collecting broodstock to meet egg-take goals. Be sure to check thisadvisory announcement.\n\nWithin the designated saltwater hatchery sport harvest area consisting of the contiguous waters of Stephens Passage, Auke Bay, Fritz Cove and Gastineau Channel, enclosed on the west by a line running from the tip of Point Louisa to the navigational aid at the northern tip of Portland Island (58o21.13’N., 134o45.52’W) then along the eastern shore of Portland Island to its most southern point and ending on Douglas Island at the northern tip of Outer Point, and enclosed on the east by a line located approximately ¼ mile south of the Dupont dock and extending across Gastineau Channel between department markers (see attached map #1).\n\nThe salt waters of Gastineau Channel within a 300-yard radius of the Wayside Park Fishing Dock (Channel Wayside fishing dock – see attached map #1 insert).\n\nKing salmon returning to the Douglas Island Pink and Chum, Inc. Macaulay Salmon Hatchery are not expected to meet broodstock goals this year. The return of hatchery produced king salmon to Juneau waters appears to be low based on the number of tag recoveries to date. Therefore, these closures are necessary to protect broodstock needed for future production.\n\nKing salmon fishing in Lena Cove remains open:\n\nThe Fish Creek Pond sport fishing closure will be removed August 10. The hatchery efforts for collecting king salmon in the Pond needed for broodstock will conclude August 8, making the closure no longer necessary.\n\nWithin Fish Creek Pond the following regulations will be in effect beginning 12:01 a.m. Saturday, August 10 through 11:59 p.m. Saturday, August 31, 2024:\n\nLink to emergency orders\n\nAlaskan resident:\n\nNonresident:\n\nIn mid-summer, Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout start migrating into local creeks, trailing adult salmon to their spawning grounds in search of salmon eggs and decaying salmon to feed on. The most effective methods for catching these fish are using egg patterns, small spinners, or spoons.

Stay informed on the most current regulations and any recent changes.\n\nMarine boat anglers returning to docks where ADF&G creel sampling is occurring (Juneau is included in this area): from now through September 14, 2025, you may not fillet, mutilate, or de-head sport-caught lingcod, nonpelagic rockfish, and king or coho salmon at sea. These fish must remain whole until your vessel is tied up at a docking facility where the fish will be offloaded, unless they’ve been consumed or preserved on board.\n\nThe purpose of this restriction is to maximize the information collected through ADF&G creel sampling and angler interviews—critical data that helps manage and sustain our fisheries.\n\nADF&G creel samplers will be present on the docks, so please be patient and respectful as they carry out this important work.\n\nAs temperatures rise and ice melts across Southeast Alaska, spring marks the return of active Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout. These anadromous fish migrate from their over-wintering lakes and ponds to feed in saltwater, especially around lake outlets and stream mouths. Shoreline fishing in coastal areas becomes productive as they congregate at creek mouths to feed on salmon smolts. Small spoons, spinners, and smolt-imitating flies are effective for targeting these fish during this active period.\n\nIn all drainages crossed by the Juneau road system, as well as the saltwater adjacent to the Juneau road system to a line ¼ mile offshore, cutthroat and rainbow trout bag limits (in combination) are 2 daily, 2 in possession with a 14-inch minimum and 22-inch maximum size limit.

Recent reports show success fishing in Lena Cove, Auke Bay, Fritz Cove, and Dupont. Please remember that the broader area will reopen to king salmon retention starting June 15th.\n\nFor comprehensive details on specific areas, including maps, bag limits, and possession regulations, please refer to our latestadvisory announcements and emergency orders. Stay informed on the most current regulations and any recent changes.\n\nMarine boat anglers returning to docks where ADF&G creel sampling is occurring (Juneau is included in this area): from now through September 14, 2025, you may not fillet, mutilate, or de-head sport-caught lingcod, nonpelagic rockfish, and king or coho salmon at sea. These fish must remain whole until your vessel is tied up at a docking facility where the fish will be offloaded, unless they’ve been consumed or preserved on board.\n\nThe purpose of this restriction is to maximize the information collected through ADF&G creel sampling and angler interviews—critical data that helps manage and sustain our fisheries.

Low water levels are making fish spook easily and difficult to catch but expect things to heat up after the next rainfall. Peak run timing varies by river system, with most runs peaking in late April. Fishing for steelhead should remain steady in most systems until early May.\n\nBe sure to check the2024 Southeast Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations. The Ketchikan Area Freshwater Special Regulations can be found on pages 30-32. Regulations vary depending on the waters you plan to fish.\n\nAs water levels increase trout and dollies will make their way out of the lakes and begin heading up stream towards spawning habitat. Excellent trout fishing has been reported along roadside systems. Expect this period of warm, sunny weather to heat up the streams and lead to aggressive fish. Try egg or fry imitations to match the natural forage this time of year.\n\nOpportunity to harvest king salmon will be available in terminal harvest areas beginning in June. On June 15, most of the Ketchikan area (District 1) and east Prince of Wales area (District 2) will open with regional king salmon limits, with a few exceptions. Please see the advisory announcements issued March 28 and April 2, 2024.\n\nHalibut can be targeted this time of year and fishing will continue to improve as summer approaches. Reminder:Filleting halibut: No person shall possess on board a vessel, including charter vessels and pleasure craft used for fishing, halibut that have been filleted, mutilated, or otherwise disfigured in any manner, except that each halibut may be cut into no more than 2 ventral pieces, 2 dorsal pieces, and 2 cheek pieces, with enough skin on each piece to identify whether the piece is from the light side or the dark side of the fish.\n\nSportfishing for lingcod is currently closed. The season will start on May 16. Reminder: the lingcod slot limit for nonresidents has changed this year.\n\nRockfish can be caught year-round. Stop by the Fish & Game office or visit the website for resources onidentifying rockfish species. Rockfish regulations remain the same as last year. All sportfishing vessels are required to have at least one deep water release device on board."

In order to not exceed the 2025 sport allocation of king salmon this closure is necessary.\n\nThe closure does not impact resident anglers. Starting July 15th, the remaining saltwater portion of the Petersburg/Wrangell area will open to resident anglers for king salmon retention with a bag and possession limit of one over 28 inches.Traditionally king salmon catches slow down over the next few weeks but they may still be caught.\n\nThere are separate regulations for the Blind Slough/Wrangell Narrows Terminal Harvest Area, City Creek, and the remainder of the region. Please see the Advisory Announcement onour websitefor maps and more specific information about each of these locations. Remember that a king salmon stamp is required whenever fishing for king salmon (including catch and release).\n\nSockeye salmon are in the saltwater now and entering some local streams. Fishing for them may be slow as they are not aggressive feeders and as such catch rates should be expectedly low. Anglers are reminded that snagging is not allowed in any area freshwaters where sockeye salmon are found.\n\nPink and Coho salmon should begin to show. Area coho fishing in marine waters traditionally gets going around the third week in July but there have been some early catches up north so we may see them sooner.\n\nHalibut catch rates tend to remain consistent in July and this is a good species to target this time of year. If looking for halibut locations, target high points under the water that come up to as shallow 100 feet. Another option might be offshore of a creek that has salmon spawning. Halibut catch rates should increase as they come into shallow waters over the summer. Traditional fishing areas such as The Eye Opener in Sumner Strait or north of town in Frederick Sound hold the most promise. Large halibut tend to be at 300 feet or greater, try to fish the slack tides with heavy duty gear and use whole herring for bait. If you are in Petersburg fishing from a small skiff and need to stay close to town, fish just south of the red buoy just outside of Wrangell Narrows in 300 to 400 feet of water.\n\nThe Halibut sport fishery is open February 1 – December 31, 2025. Reminder: Filleting halibut: No person shall possess on board a vessel, including charter vessels and pleasure craft used for fishing, halibut that have been filleted, mutilated, or otherwise disfigured in any manner, except that each halibut may be cut into no more than 2 ventral pieces, 2 dorsal pieces, and 2 cheek pieces, with enough skin on each piece to identify whether the piece is from the light side or the dark side of the fish.\n\nResidents are allowed a daily bag limit of 1; 2 in possession. Nonresidents are allowed a daily bag limit of 1; 1 in possession; 30-35 inches or 55 inches and longer. There is an annual limit of 2 fish, 1 of which is 30-35 inches in length, and 1 that is 55 inches or greater in length. A harvest record is required. The Northern Southeast Area is closed to nonresidents for lingcod fishing from June 15 - August 15, 2025.\n\nRockfish regulations have changed since the last fishing season. The retention of demersal shelf rockfish, including yelloweye, is open for residents of Alaska with a daily bag limit of 1; 2 in possession. Demersal shelf rockfish, including yelloweye, will be open for nonresidents from July 1 through August 25 with an annual limit of 1 fish. Slope Rockfish are open to resident and nonresidents with a daily bag limit of 1; 1 in possession. Pelagic Rockfish are open to resident and nonresidents with a daily bag limit of 3; 6 in possession. A helpful species identification guide has been published on theADFG website. Anglers are reminded that a rockfish release device is now required to be used whenever releasing rockfish, and a rockfish release device must be onboard your vessel whenever sport fishing in marine waters.\n\nResident cutthroat and Dolly Varden can also be found in area streams and lakes accessible by the Petersburg and Wrangell road systems. Often overlooked by anglers with their sites on salmon, these smaller fish can offer plenty of fun on lighter tackle. July is a good time to catch these fish, though depending on where you are at you might have to avoid the pink salmon that will fill the streams.\n\nAlaska Department of Fish and Game creel samplers have been on the public docks since mid-May approaching anglers to ask about their catch. The biological samples they collect are used to help manage and sustain a healthy stock required for recreational angling. Please be courteous and provide them with the few minutes needed to gather this important information."

    "full_text": "Recent Emergency Orders & Press Releases for Sitka\n\nKing salmon fishing has been good with anglers reporting in many areas around Sitka – including the typical locations (Biorka, Vitskari, and off Kruzoff). Kings are also returning to the Medvejie Hatchery and Silver Bay. Currently, there are no special regulations for kings returning to Medvejie or Silver Bay (regional regulations apply). There is a small area near the barrier net behind the net pens at Medvejie that is now closed to fishing in order to allow hatchery staff access to broodstock. Signs are posted. Resident Anglers are allowed one king daily with no annual limit. The nonresident king fishery isclosedas of July 7th.\n\nFor other salmon: Coho are starting to show up offshore and there have been reports of them being large for this early. Chum have also recently shown in Sitka Sound in force. Sockeye salmon are starting off strong. As of 7/6, over 39,900 have passed through the Redoubt Weir. It’s still early for Pink Salmon.\n\nOne of the substantial changes for fishing this year is that resident anglers must comply with nonresident fishing regulations when fishing in the EEZ. The EEZ or Exclusive Economic Zone is the water that is generally from 3 miles offshore out to 200 miles. There are some exceptions to this (like Sitka Sound) where there’s an imaginary line that cuts across the sound from offshore of Biorka to Cape Edgcumbe. There are maps depicting this in the 2025 regulatory summary on p. 10 and posted at most of the harbors. While this doesn’t affect nonresidents (there is no differentiation between state waters and the EEZ for nonresidents) resident anglers must comply with nonresident regulations when fishing in the EEZ. This includes any size, bag, or annual limits. Further, anglers may not be in possession of a fish that would be otherwise illegal to possess in the waters in which they are fishing. For example, if a resident angler caught a 45 inch lingcod in state waters (after May 15th), they could not then go out to the EEZ and fish for any species because nonresident anglers are limited to one lingcod between 30 and 35 inches.\n\nResident anglers are subject to and must record any harvest of species that has an annual limit when fishing in the EEZ. This will include king salmon, lingcod, and nonpelagic rockfish in addition to steelhead and sharks (which must be recorded in state waters as well).\n\nFishing for halibut is open. Fishing for halibut is good and stays relatively consistent through the summer. These fish will begin to show up in greater numbers as weather warms and other fisheries move more inshore. SeeNOAAfor sport fishing regulations.\n\nFor all anglers, the fishing season openedMay 16. The resident season will run through the end of November.There is amidseason closurefor nonresident anglers From June 15th through August 15. Fishing for lingcod has been good.\n\nIn 2025,Demersal Shelf Rockfish (DSR) is open year-round for residents. Residents are allowed one fish daily with no annual limit (in State Waters). Nonresidents are allowed one DSR daily and one annually from July 1-August 25. Here’s a helpfulrockfish Idlink to common rockfish groups. DSR are a subset of nonpelagic rockfish including: Yelloweye, Quillback, China, Tiger, Rosethorn, Copper, and Canary.\n\nAll anglers are allowedonedaily, two in possession all year with no annual limit. The most common slope rockfish include: Redbanded, Rougheye, Silvergray, Shortraker, and Vermilion.\n\nFishing for pelagic rockfish is open all year and typically good year-round. The most commonly caught pelagic rockfish in the Sitka Area are the Black and Yellowtail, although Duskys aren’t uncommon. Try fishing around underwater structures near kelp beds with a dart or jig. These rockfish make for excellent table fare.\n\nAnglers are allowed five daily, ten in possession, with theexception of CSEO (Sitka Area),where residents are allowed three a day, six in possession, and nonresidents are allowed two daily, four in possession. See the Sitka Area Special Exceptions for a map of CSEO on page 25 of the 2025 Southeast Regulation Summary. The department has developed aguideto assist anglers in identifying species groupings. If you’d like a copy of this on waterproof paper, stop by the office for a free one.\n\nBe sure to check your local fishing regulations to be aware of harvest limits, size requirements and necessary permits for shellfish. Also be aware that certain types of shellfish in Southeast Alaska have been known to cause Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) which can be fatal.\n\nFor Dungeness crab, try placing pots in bays and around the mouths of river where crabs congregate to feed. If fishing with friends, be sure to keep each angler’s catch separate to avoid pooling bag limits.\n\nCheck out the newgofishakinteractive map to discover popular fishing locations and information on species run timing, fishing gear selections, and boat and angler access tips!\n\nFor further information, please feel free to contact the Sitka area sportfish management staff at(907) 747-5355."

    "full_text": "Recent Emergency Orders & Press Releases for Yakutat\n\nSockeye fishing continues to be good on the Situk River. Water levels are normal and have made fishing quite good. Weir counts have us tracking above the escapement goal range, with over 40,000 fish estimated to have gone past the weir so far at roughly 48% of the run historically. As a result, the bag limit for sockeye salmon on the Situk River has increased from 3 per day to 6 per day. Fish are spread through out the river. The Situk River within 50 yards of both upstream/downstream of the 9-mile Bridge is closed to sport fishing.\n\nDolly fishing should be excellent. Large numbers of Dolly Varden are present in the Situk River and other freshwaters in the Yakutat management area. They are feasting on emigrating pink salmon fry, and salmon smolt. Almost any lure or fly can be used to catch them. Try mimicking salmon smolt or fry when choosing a lure.\n\nCutthroat trout fishing continues to be excellent right now. The best location to target them is Tawah Creek. The Tawah Creek within 50 yards of both upstream/downstream of the Cannon Beach Road Bridge is closed to sport fishing. They are spread throughout the drainage and are similar to Dolly Varden in that you can use a variety of lures or flies to target them.\n\nSportfishing for king salmon is open in Yakutat area marine waters. Fishing for kings this last week was very slow. Fishing for king salmon closed to non-resident anglers on Monday, July 7th. Most anglers troll spoons or herring behind a flasher. Please check the department website below for the recent emergency order and advisory announcements regarding 2025 regional king salmon regulations for Southeast Alaska.\n\nHalibut fishing this past week was good, however more smaller fish continue to be caught compared to earlier in the season, however some really nice fish are being caught for those who can get out farther offshore. The marine weather has been good for the most part and has allowed anglers to get out to wherever they want to this last week, with most anglers going out front of Yakutat Bay. Dogfish are present, so moving around to avoid them might be necessary. We are in the middle of the halibut season, so fishing should remain good for the next month or so. The forecast looks a little rough next week with rain and wind event scattered throughout. Anglers are anchoring up and soaking herring/octopus/salmon heads on circle hooks or using baited jigs as they drift.\n\nLingcod fishing is open in the Yakutat area.Fishing has been excellent so far. Please check the department website for the recent emergency order and advisory annoucements regarding changes to lingcod regulations in the Yakutat management area. Using a variety of jigs (lead-head, dart) over rocky structures is the best method for catching lingcod, although a double snelled octopus hook set-up baited with herring works well too.\n\nFishing for rockfish is good in the Yakutat area. Dart jigs or mooching with herring over rocky pinnacles works best. Please check the department website for the recent emergency order and advisory annoucements regarding changes to rockfish regulations in 2025 for Southeast Alaska.\n\nFor further information, please get in touch with the Yakutat Area Sport Fish management biologist Jason Pawluk at(907) 784-3222.\n\nEmergency orders can befound on our website.\n\nCheck out the newgofishakinteractive map to discover popular fishing locations and information on species run timing, fishing gear selections, and boat and angler access tips!"

While most of the early-season action was concentrated in the southern portion of the THA, the bite has now shifted north.\n\nAnglers are currently having the most success in areas like Lena Cove and the North Douglas/Fritz Cove area, which have become the latest hot spots. The south end of Gastineau Channel is still producing a few fish, but not at the pace seen earlier in the season.\n\nIn addition to kings, we’re starting to see a good number of coho showing up on the docks! Anglers are harvesting cohos from Pt. Retreat, North Shelter and Lincoln Islands, Funter Bay, and around Benjamin Island. Chums and pinks are also coming in, with most of them being caught in the same areas where coho are being found.\n\nOverall, the season is in full swing and fishing opportunities continue to be strong in the Juneau area.\n\nThe Juneau area is fortunate to have a THA where both residents and nonresidents can continue to harvest king salmon within the designated boundaries. It is important to note thatsport fishing for king salmon and all snagging is prohibited within a300-yard radius of the Wayside Park Fishing Dockto protect salmon attempting to reach the fish ladder at the Macaulay Salmon Hatchery.\n\nFor comprehensive details on specific areas, including maps, bag limits, and possession regulations, please refer to our latestadvisory announcements and emergency orders. Stay informed on the most current regulations and any recent changes.\n\nHalibut fishing is in full swing, and anglers are having solid success throughout the Juneau area. We’re now in the prime of the season, and more people are targeting halibut with good results.\n\nSome of the hottest spots continue to be North Shelter and Lincoln Island, along with Homeshore, Benjamin Island, and the waters around Hoonah/Icy Strait Point. While these areas are producing consistently, halibut are being caught in many other locations as well.\n\nIf you’ve been thinking about heading out, now’s a great time to go!\n\nIt's important to note that halibut fishing is federally managed. For detailed information on sport fishing regulations and guidelines forcharter (guided)vsunguided halibutregulations in Southeast Alaska, please visitNOAA's website.\n\nA few sablefish have been harvested recently near Point Howard, Couverden Rocks, and the Lynn Sisters. These deep-dwelling fish can be challenging to target, but for those willing to put in the effort, the reward is well worth it.\n\nDeepwater release devices are mandatory for all saltwater vessels.All vessels must have at least one functional deepwater release mechanism on board and readily available for use when sport fishing activities are taking place regardless of species targeted.\n\nAll rockfish not retained must be released at the depth they were caught or 100 feet, whichever is shallower.\n\nPlease visit our link to view deep water release deviceexamples and tipsand how these mechanisms are a helpful tool forconservation.\n\nAnglers are beginning to see more consistent rockfish catches around the Juneau area, coinciding with the recent uptick in halibut fishing. Duskies have made up the bulk of the reports so far, with a few Silvergray, Rougheye, Quillback, Redbanded, and Yelloweye rockfish also starting to show up on the docks. Most of these rockfish have been caught in the waters near North Shelter, Lincoln Island, Benjamin Island, and Point Retreat. As always, please follow current regulations and handle any released fish with care to help support the long-term health of these valuable stocks.\n\nNot all rockfish species found in Alaska are listed above. For a complete list of species you may encounter in Alaska, please visitour website.\n\nIn mid-summer, Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout have begun moving into local creeks to feast on salmon eggs. The best way to catch these fish is by using egg patterns or small spinners and spoons. Make sure to visitGo Fish AKand explore the interactive map to identify the species you're interested in fishing for.\n\nIn all drainages crossed by the Juneau road system, as well as the saltwater adjacent to the Juneau road system to a line 1/4 mile offshore, cutthroat and rainbow trout bag limits (in combination) are 2 daily, 2 in possession with a 14-inch minimum and 22-inch maximum size limit. Dolly Varden limits are 2 daily, 2 in possession, no size limit. Anglers should check the 2025Southeast Alaska Sport Fish Regulation Summaryor special regulations specific to the stream or lake they intend to fish.\n\nPersonal use red and blue king crab fishing opened on July 1st, exclusively for Alaskan residents.To participate, anglers must hold a valid sport fishing license along with a 2025/2026 Southeast Alaska Regional Personal Use King Crab Permit. These are available atthe ADF&G online store. Please check for Personal UseEmergency Orders, legal-size and pot configurations, and restrictions online.Section 11-A is currently CLOSED to Alaskan resident PU king crab fishing. Stay tuned for the Juneau area PU announcement later this year using the link above. Harvest must bereported online.

While taking Dungeness crab, 5 pots or 10 rings per person may be used, with a max of 10 pots or 20 rings per vessel. While taking Tanner crab, no more than 4 pots or 10 rings per vessel may be used. In total, no more than 5 pots per person and 10 pots per vessel may be used for taking shellfish regardless of pot type.\n\nFor nonresidents in the Juneau area, licensed anglers can keep 3 male Tanner and Dungeness crab (in combination). Tanner males need to be 5 1/2 inch minimum width and Dungeness males need to be 6 1/2 inch minimum width.\n\nSport and personal use shrimp fisheries in the Juneau and Tenakee area will remain CLOSEDuntil further notice. The closed area consists of all marine waters of Section 11-A north and west of a line extending from a regulatory marker near point Bishop to the Coast Guard marker and light on Point Arden, extending to a line at the latitude of Little Island light, and east of a line from Little Island light to Point Retreat light.

This will impact all waters in the Ketchikan Management Area except for the Herring Bay Terminal Harvest Area, which will remain open through July 31. The regional closure is necessary to keep the sport fishery within the 2025 sport allocation.\n\nKing salmon fishing has been strong, with the latter half of June and early July typically considered the peak period. Productive king salmon fishing areas around Ketchikan include the backside of Gravina Island, Clover Pass, and Herring Bay.\n\nA few summer coho are starting to show up, and catch rates are expected to improve as we move through July.\n\nHalibut fishing has picked up throughout June and is expected to remain strong throughout July. As the summer progresses, halibut will continue moving into shallower waters, improving access for anglers. Productive areas include Duke Island, Gravina Island/Vallenar Point, and Cape Chacon.\n\nLingcod fishing has been good.\n\nRockfish can be caught year-round. Stop by the Fish & Game office or visit the website for resources onidentifying rockfish species. All sportfishing vessels are required to have at least one deep water release device on board.\n\nDemersal shelf rockfish are the following species: yelloweye, quillback, canary, China, copper, tiger, and rosethorn.\n\nPelagic rockfish species include black, dark, dusky, widow, and yellowtail.\n\nTrout and Dolly Varden fishing is good in rivers and lakes throughout July. It is often an overlooked fishery while anglers target salmon. With lighter tackle and abundant fish, anglers often find success. When fishing lakes, concentrate your efforts near the inlet and outlet, where fish tend to congregate. Early July is a good time to target these fish before pink salmon begin moving into freshwater.\n\nADF&G creel technicians are on the docks interviewing anglers, participation is important and only takes a couple of minutes. During an interview, creel samplers will ask a few short questions about your fishing trip and collect biological data from the fish harvested. The data collected through this program is essential for the sustainable management of sport fisheries, guiding management decisions to ensure fishing and harvest opportunities are maintained for the future.\n\nAn excellent resource for planning a trip is thegofishakinteractive map for Ketchikan which provides information on popular fishing locations, species run timing, fishing gear selections and boat and angler access."

Be advised that anglers are restricted by the regulations for the waters they are fishing in, andbag limits are not cumulative between areas. For example, an angler who caught 3 coho salmon on the Chilkat River one day would not be allowed to keep any coho salmon that same day on the Chilkoot River, as they would already have exceeded the Chilkoot daily limit.\n\nAfter feeding for the summer in near-shore salt waters,Dolly Vardenandcutthroat troutreturn to the larger rivers, such as the Chilkat, Chilkoot, and Taiya Rivers, before finding lakes and deep fresh waters for the winter.

However, some angling opportunities still exist during the winter months. Any pond or lake that will normally hold trout and salmon in the summer months should contain some “over-wintering” trout and Dolly Varden. The water will need to be deep enough to flow below the ice surface and provide enough room for fish to feed and swim throughout the winter. Ice fishing is typically done with light tackle and with the use of an “auger” to open a hole in the ice. Remember, most lakes in the Juneau area are off limits to the use of bait so be sure to check the regulations after selecting a place to fish. It’s always a good idea to check the local weather conditions and ice thickness before heading onto the ice. Be safe and have fun.\n\nIn addition to freshwater ice fishing, anglers can target king salmon while trolling the salt waters near Juneau. King salmon are present in local marine waters throughout the year. The following regulations apply for the 2015/2016 winter season:"

    "full_text": "Spring fishing opportunities in the Juneau area include; king salmon, Dolly Varden, cutthroat trout, steelhead, and halibut. King salmon can be found in the saltwater areas near False Outer Point, Auke Bay, Tee Harbor, the Breadline, and Point Bishop. These areas have been known to provide the best chance to catch an early season king salmon. During this time, Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout begin to congregate at the mouths of local creeks such as Salmon Creek, Sheep Creek, and Cowee Creek to feed on emigrating salmon smolts.   Using small smolt imitation fly patterns or small spinners is the best way to catch these aggressive fish.  Steelhead can also be pursued during this time as they begin their return to natal streams to spawn. Peterson Creek and Cowee Creek are the two most popular spots to try to catch a steelhead on the Juneau road system. During this time halibut begin to move into the interior waters surrounding Juneau as catch rates slowly increase with the onset of summer.\n\nSpring king season is in full swing by May and offers saltwater enthusiasts the chance to land a real lunker! Please check the current year's News Release for up to date regulations including current bag and possession limits. Non-resident anglers will be subject to an annual limit, and most areas require a minimum size limit of 28” for king salmon. In Southeast, almost all kings are harvested in saltwater and are incredible table fare. You can fish from shore at one of the many popular shoreside “points” around Juneau, or head out in the boat. Shoreside anglers begin fishing the Picnic Cove and Tee Harbor shorelines in March, but catch rates usually don't pick up until about mid April. Shoreline fishing should continue to be good until the end of May. Casting with large spoons or small herring seem to be the most successful shoreside methods. If you are fishing from a boat, there is no shortage of specialized king salmon gear, so find your favorite flasher, spoon or herring rig and try your luck at trolling to entice these prized fish to bite. ADF&G Marine Creel personnel begin their surveys of shoreside fishing areas in mid to late March.  Please help them collect the requested information so that ADF&G can continue to sustainably manage king salmon stocks.\n\nTypically steelhead anglers aim to intercept the fish as they enter into streams from the salt water in late April though May. Often, entire days can be spent searching for a few quality “looks” at a fish, so don’t be discouraged if it takes time, because the fight in a fresh steelhead will make it all worth while. Most streams that contain steelhead in southeast have small annual returns (in the hundreds) and thus can be vulnerable to over-fishing. Retention of steelhead in the Juneau area is prohibitied. Any steelhead caught in a drainage crossed by the Juneau road system must be released immediately.  Current regionwide regulations elsewhere prohibit any steelhead under 36” from being harvested and require that a harvest record be completed in ink immediately upon landing a steelhead that is to be harvested. There are a number of streams on the Juneau road system that contain small runs of steelhead that are easily fishable. Keep in mind that all fish should be treated with great care regardless of size to ensure the best chances for survival upon release.\n\nSpring is the time when sea run Dolly Varden and other trout begin eating more and preparing for the summer in area salt waters. During the spring, some of these fish will exit their “over wintering” sites (lakes and ponds) and head downstream for the ocean. These fish are known as “anadromous” fish. Lake outlets and streams that connect to the salt water are prime places to harvest these fish in the spring. After the outmigration, the saltwater shoreline fishing can be very productive as Dollys and other trout begin to spend most of their time looking for food by cruising the rocky coves and bays. Spoons and spinners work well, as do smolt and fry imitation flies. There will also be some fish that do not exit their “over wintering” sites and head for the ocean. Known as “residents”, these fish stay in their home lake, pond, or corresponding stream the entire year. While these fish may move around in the system to take advantage of food or environmental conditions, they will be present for your fishing pleasure all year."

    "full_text": "Late summer brings excellent freshwater trout fishing as Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout begin to feed on salmon eggs. Any stream that has runs of pink and chum salmon will also have aggressive trout. Using egg patterns or small spinners is the best way to catch these feeding trout. During late summer and early fall coho salmon begin to show up in local watersheds. These silver salmon are found in large numbers in Gastineau Channel as they return to DIPAC hatchery, accessible from various turnouts along Egan Drive and Douglas highway, and at Sheep Creek near Thane. Cohos can be intercepted as they return to Montana Creek, Cowee Creek, and Peterson Creek to spawn. Targeting cohos with large fly patterns or spinners is effective. Silver salmon fishing can be good into November, but typically peaks near the end of September. Saltwater fishing for cohos in August in area marine waters can also be quite productive, with fewer pinks around to steal your bait. Fishing for halibut is also decent during August and early September as these fish stay in the interior waters near Juneau to feed on salmon carcasses.\n\nChum(dog), and pink (humpies) salmon arrive in Juneau area marine waters during July, but usually have peaked by early August, except during odd years when higher pink salmon abundance may extend the season. Coho (silver) salmon fishing is great during August and September with peak marine catch rates occurring by about mid August and freshwater catch rates peaking mid-September into October. Some popular marine angling spots for coho salmon are the Breadline, North and South Shelter Island, Pt. Retreat, and the western shoreline of Admirlaty island. Cohos bound for Canada up the Taku River can also be caught at Pt. Salisbury, Pt. Bishop, and the backside of Douglas Island. These aggresive, hard-fighting salmon make great table fare and are also fun to catch in marine waters and in their natal streams.\n\nMany anglers consider August and September to be the best time for freshwater fishing in the Juneau area. Pink and chum salmon fishing can still be quite good during the first couple weeks of August. Some good fishing spots for pink and chum salmon include Cowee Creek, Echo Cove, Amalga Harbor, and Macauley Hatchery. Anglers in pursuit of coho salmon will find good fishing at Montana Creek, Lena Pt., Cowee Creek, Peterson Creek, Amalga Harbor, Macauley Hatchery, and at the new release site at the mouth Sheep Creek below the bridge. Remember that the bag limit for coho salmon in Juneau freshwater systems is 2 fish per day, 2 in possession. Six coho salmon can be kept daily with 12 in possession from saltwater, which is defined as those waters below mean low tide. Anglers are reminded to check the Sport Fishing Regulations summary booklet or contact the Juneau area office if they have any questions about regulations.\n\nDuring late summer and fall, sea run Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout continue to follow the salmon into freshwater stream systems. These egg predators also feed on decaying salmon flesh, which provides additional nutrients to freshwaters and riparian zones stimulating periphyton and insect production. Salmon carcasses bring marine derived nutrients to stream systems that feed a variety of fish, birds, mammals and streamside vegetation for many months. Anglers can be succesful with egg patterns, beads, egg-sucking leaches, flesh imitation flies, small spinners and small spoons. Bag and possession limits for cutthroat trout are more restrictive and size restrictions apply. The regionwide regulations for cutthroat are 2 per day, 2 in possession, with a 14 inch minimum and 22 inch maximum length. Don’t assume that the water you are fishing falls under the regionwide regulations until you have checked to see if there are specific exceptions for that spot. Some popular fishing spots for Dollys and cutthroat trout include Montana Creek, Peterson Creek, Cowee Creek, Gastineau Channel, Auke Lake, and Windfall Creek (closed June and July) and lake.\n\nSport and Personal Use shrimp and king crab fishing is still closed in area waters closest to Juneau (11-A) due to low abundance, but Dungeoness and Tanner crabbing can be quite good in the Juneau Area during late summer and early fall. During this period these species are actively feeding on salmon carcasses washed out of the estuaries.  For Tanner crab, August and September are also historically the months with the lowest levels of bitter tasting meat caused Bitter Crab Syndrome. Please check the Sport Fishing Regulations Summary Booklet, or call the Juneau area Fish and Game office to determine which sport and personal use regulations apply, how many pots are allowed and how they should be configured, how to identify male crab, what sizes are legal, and what the daily bag and possession limits are for each species."

    "full_text": "Summer brings an increase in fishing opportunities as salmon begin to migrate into local watersheds on their way to natal spawning grounds or hatchery release sites. During this time large numbers of king salmon, pink salmon, and chum salmon can be found throughout the Juneau area. Saltwater king salmon fishing opportunities include; Auke Bay, Fritz Cove Road, North Douglas, and Gastineau Channel. These areas host good catch rates as large numbers of hatchery king salmon move through the area on their return to hatchery release sites at DIPAC, Fish Creek pond, and the mouth of Auke Creek. These king salmon may be targeted in all saltwater areas and freshwater drainages along the Juneau road system icnluding Fish Creek and Fish Creek pond. Sockeye salmon can be found at Windfall Creek where sport fishing is prohibited from June 1st– July 31st, except for Wednesdays and Saturdays during the month of June. Pink and chum salmon can be found in large numbers near the mouths of freshwater streams as they begin their spawning migration. Pink salmon are notoriously aggressive and make up the largest runs of any species of Pacific salmon. During this time, Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout can be found in Cowee Creek, Montana Creek and Sheep Creek as they move upstream to coincide with the arrival of the salmon. Halibut fishing begins to pick up during this time and halibut can be found in Icy Straits, North Pass, Halibut Cove, and the reefs north of Shelter Island.\n\nCoho (silver), chum (dog), and pink (humpies) salmon arrive in Juneau area marine waters during June and July. Marine harvest rates for chum and pink salmon peak around the end of July to the first of August. Coho salmon fishing is generally excellent later in the year but cohos will start to show up in the marine fisheries in mid-summer. King salmon are also present in good numbers near the hatchery release sites. Some popular marine angling spots are the Breadline, Pt. Salisbury, Pt. Bishop, the backside of Douglas Island, North and South Shelter Island, and Pt. Retreat.\n\nAnglers usually harvest salmon in marine waters by trolling or mooching herring, hoochies, flies, or plugs. Trolling involves actively pulling terminal fishing gear through the water fast enough to provide a spin or roll which imitates a wounded baitfish. Mooching is done from an anchored or drifting boat and is an effective technique when fishing in medium to strong currents. This type of fishing involves jigging or mooching gear that allows the gear to flutter and drift with the current.\n\nMany anglers consider late July through September to be the best time to fish freshwater streams in the Juneau area. Pink and chum salmon fishing is excellent during the last few weeks of July and first couple weeks of August. Some good fishing spots for pink and chum salmon include Cowee Creek, Echo Cove, Amalga Harbor, and Macauley Hatchery. Freshwater anglers have success with spinners, spoons, and flies. Hardware anglers typically use bright colors, but can also have good luck with silver or black. Fly anglers will have good luck with red, orange, black, or green colored streamers, egg sucking leaches, and egg patterns. Try a variety of retrieves from “dead” drifting along the bottom to quick strips of the line across the upper part of the water column. Following Board of Fisheries action taken during January of 2015, freshwater drainages crossed by the Juneau Road System that are open to sport fishing were opened year-round to king salmon fishing with a bag and possession limit of 4 fish of any size. King salmon caught by nonresidents in these drainages do not count toward their annual limit. In addition, liberlized methods and means went into effect for Fish Creek Pond from June 1- August 31. Please consult the Southeast Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summary Booklet for these regulations.\n\nAlthough saltwater shoreline catch rates for king salmon have generally ended by the first week of June, good catches of hatchery king salmon in good condition can often be had at the mouth of Fish Creek on Douglas and along the shoreline at DIPAC from mid to late June. Casting with large spoons or sinners or mooching with plugs will often entice a strike. Snagging is prohibited in saltwater at the mouth of Auke Creek, at the mouth of Fish Creek, at the mouth of Peterson Creek, and off the Gastineau Channel Wayside Park fishing dock.\n\nDuring the summer months, sea run Dolly Varden follow salmon from marine waters into freshwater systems. “Dollys” are often associated with spawning salmon and can be seen feeding on salmon eggs. Anglers are successful with egg imitation patterns like beads or egg sucking leaches. Dolly Varden also actively feed on salmon carcasses and are often taken with flesh imitation flies. Anglers using spinning tackle can have success with small spinners, pixies and other spoons.\n\nSea run cutthroat trout can be found near stream mouths and along area shorelines. The abundance of sea run cutthroat trout is low compared to sea run Dolly Varden, so bag and possession limits are more restrictive and size restrictions apply. The regulations for cutthroat are 2 per day, 2 in possession, with a 14 inch minimum and 22 inch maximum length. Please check the regulation summary booklet for the watershed you are fishing for trout regulations.  Similar techniques used for harvesting Dolly’s can be effective while fishing for sea-run cutthroat. Some popular fishing spots for Dollys and cutthroat trout include Montana Creek, Peterson Creek (including the saltchuck), Cowee Creek, Gastineau Channel, Auke Lake, and Windfall Creek (closed June and July) and Windfall Lake.\n\nSome freshwater opportunities exist for trout and char that are partially or completely isolated from marine waters. On the Juneau road system, these systems include Peterson Creek (above the falls) and lake, Cropley Lake, Salmon Creek Reservoir (brook trout), Dredge Lakes, and Fish Creek above Eaglecrest Road. Dolly Varden and trout caught in these systems are generally small (6” – 10”) and are mostly considered to be resident fish.\n\nFishing for Dungeoness and Tanner crab is open in the the immediate Juneau area. King crab and shrimp fishing in the area closest to Juneau (Section 11-A) are currently closed due to low abundance. Opportunites to fish for these species exist outside the immediate Juneau area but there are limited bag and possession limits.  Anglers should check with the Juneau area Fish and Game office to determine which sport and personal use regulations apply before setting pots."

Sport fishing gear is limited to one unbaited, single-hook, artificial lure with a gap between the point and shank of the hook of ½ inch or less. The Eklutna Tailrace is a stocked fishery where you can use bait and multiple hooks. Fishing has been fair to good. Try drifting bait under a bobber or a variety of lures in sizes 3-5. Kodiak customs, Vibrax, and Pixies work well.\n\nSummit Lake in Hatcher Pass was recently stocked. This lake is in a beautiful spot and the road over the pass is open. Enjoy fishing and hiking while the summer weather is at its best. Other aesthetically pleasing lakes include the lakes up the Glenn HWY, Long Lake (Mile 86), Ravine, or Knob Lakes off the Alascom Road.\n\nPlease review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nDon't forget to purchase your 2025 sport fishing license and king stamp!

More consistent success is coming from offshore locations but those looking for bigger fish could try shallow water from Bluff Point to Anchor Point. Fishing around slack tide is the best time for targeting halibut so you can hold the bottom with less weight. Herring on a circle hook is the most popular bait; however, octopus, salmon heads, and jigs also work well\n\nKing salmon fishing south of Bluff Point has been spotty, with scattered reports from the Bluff area as well as throughout inner Kachemak Bay. Spawning herring have been spotted within the bay, with better fishing at times near those schools. Small troll herring or spoons behind a flasher is the most popular setup, but hootchies and tube flies will also produce fish. To find king salmon at any location, try setting the gear at different depths including mid-water column and 10 feet off the bottom.\n\nRockfish can be caught throughout Kachemak Bay and Cook Inlet by jigging or trolling. Don’t forget to use a deepwater release mechanism if you need to release one, and keep in mind that the bag limit has been reduced to 3.\n\nWest Cook Inlet is open to razor clamming, but east Cook Inlet is closed. Access to west Cook Inlet is primarily by charter boat from the tractor launch at Deep Creek, but private boats and planes are also used. Tides will be large enough by the end of the week to dig for clams. The most popular locations are Polly Creek, Crescent River Bar, and Clam Cove in Chinitna Bay. Digging has been good to excellent in recent seasons.\n\nSurf fishing on Cook Inlet beaches has been slow to fair recently. Anglers are catching a variety of groundfish including halibut, sculpins, skates, sharks, flounders, and cod. Regulations changed at the December 2023 Board of Fisheries meeting to allow surf fishing for groundfish in the conservation zones surrounding the Anchor River, Deep Creek and Ninilchik River. You still may not fish within 200 yards of the stream mouths – look out for posted orange regulatory signs. Don’t forget about fishing off the tip of the Homer Spit – that location can be productive for a variety of groundfish.\n\nThe Homer Reservoir (located on Skyline Drive) is a great place to take kids and catch a Dolly Varden. The fish are small, but can be voracious. Dollies are often found along the shore by the road, or the south shore. Try a variety of very small spinners and spoons.

    "full_text": "Recent Emergency Orders & Press Releases for Southern Kenai/LCI\n\nThe Anchor River and Deep Creek are closed to all sport fishing through July 15, 2024.\n\nThe Ninilchik River is open to fishing for hatchery king salmon June 8-10. It’s also open for a youth only fishery on June 5. The fishing should be slow to fair. The counts of both wild and hatchery fish are low but continuing steadily. Large tides this week may produce improved counts. Try cured salmon roe under a slip bobber. Size 4 or 5 pink or chartreuse spinners could be effective, too. If you incidentally hook a steelhead or wild king salmon, get them to the bank as quickly as possible and release them without removing them from the water.\n\nHalibut fishing improved near Bluff Point last week with some larger fish caught. The fishing remained fairly consistent in the Inlet and at locations like Flat Island. Fishing around slack tide is the best time for targeting halibut so you can hold the bottom with less weight. Herring on a circle hook is the most popular bait; however, octopus, salmon heads, and jigs also work well.\n\nKing salmon fishing south of Bluff Point improved last week with reports of good catches near the Bluff area. It remained spotty at other locations throughout Kachemak Bay. Small troll herring or spoons behind a flasher is the most popular setup, but hootchies and tube flies will also produce fish. To find king salmon at any location, try setting the gear at different depths including mid-water column and 10 feet off the bottom.\n\nSurf fishing anglers were finding success on several of the Cook Inlet beaches last weekend, including the Deep Creek area. Popular locations for halibut include Kasilof, Clam Gulch, Ninilchik boat harbor, Deep Creek campground, and Whiskey Gulch. Anglers are catching a variety of groundfish including halibut, sculpins, skates, sharks, flounders, and cod. Regulations changed at the December 2023 Board of Fisheries meeting to allow surf fishing for groundfish in the conservation zones surrounding the Anchor River, Deep Creek and Ninilchik River. You still may not fish within 200 yards of the stream mouths – look out for posted orange regulatory signs. Don’t forget about fishing off the tip of the Homer Spit – that location can be productive for a variety of groundfish.\n\nKing salmon fishing has continued at a slow pace in the NDFL – fish are present in the lagoon, but expect slow fishing to continue this week. Fishing the incoming or outgoing tide is typically your best bet – the tide should be flooding into the lagoon around the +11 ft height. Roe or a chunk of herring under a bobber and spinners are both effective methods for king salmon here.\n\nFishing is off to a slow start here, but a few king salmon have been caught. Anglers typically target kings near the bridge in town or in the lagoon. Try cured eggs or herring under a slip bobber, or spinners.\n\nThe Homer Reservoir (located on Skyline Drive) is a great place to take kids and catch a Dolly Varden.

Flies, plugs, and spoons will work well too. If you incidentally hook a wild king salmon, get them to the bank as quickly as possible and release them without removing them from the water.\n\nChina Poot personal use dipnet fishery has been producing limits of sockeye salmon for most making the trip across the bay. Water conditions are still high which makes spotting fish more difficult.\n\nHalibut fishing remained productive for large fish over last week. Larger fish were coming from many locations including Cook Inlet and the outer coast near the Chugach Islands. Flat Island has been consistent with good numbers of smaller fish.

There be a couple of pink salmon showing up so pay close attention that you are keeping sockeye salmon.\n\nHalibut fishing has been really good with all of the favorable marine weather. The marine forecast suggest that the seas may limit fishing a bit more this week. Herring on a circle hook is the most popular bait; however, octopus, salmon heads, and jigs also work well.\n\nKing salmon fishing south of Bluff Point was still productive over the last week. Expect small numbers of king salmon scattered throughout Kachemak Bay. Small troll herring or spoons behind a flasher is the most popular setup, but hootchies and tube flies will also produce fish. To find king salmon at any location, try setting the gear at different depths including mid-water column and 10 feet off the bottom.\n\nThe calm seas over the last week provided good opportunity to make it to the outer coast and the lingcod fishing was good. Except similar fishing when seas are favorable to make it out to the Chugach Islands area.\n\nSockeye salmon fishing in China Poot was exceptional through the weekend. Tutka Bay Lagoon was fair and pink salmon are starting to arrive. Expect similar conditions over the week.\n\nSurf fishing at the tip of the Homer spit has provided anglers a variety of groundfish including halibut, sculpins, skates, sharks, flounders, and cod.\n\nSmall numbers of coho salmon were caught in the lagoon last week. Expect poor fishing until more fish show up. Salmon roe clusters or chunks of herring suspended under a bobber will likely be the best bet for getting coho salmon to bite.\n\nThe Homer Reservoir (located on Skyline Drive) is a great place to take catch Dolly Varden. The fish are small, but can be fun to catch. Dollies are often found along the shore by the road, or the south shore. Try a variety of very small spinners and spoons.

Fishing was slow over the last weekend, but the number of king salmon holding in river may build over the week. Spinners and spoons are the best bet since the fishery is closed to the use of bait this season. If you incidentally hook a steelhead or wild king salmon, get them to the bank as quickly as possible and release them without removing them from the water.\n\nHalibut fishing continues to improve as more fish move into Cook Inlet from overwintering waters. For those looking for bigger fish, try the shallow water from Bluff Point to Anchor Point. Fishing around slack tide is the best time for targeting halibut so you can hold the bottom with less weight. Herring on a circle hook is the most popular bait; however, octopus, salmon heads, and jigs also work well.\n\nKing salmon fishing south of Bluff Point has been fair with scattered reports from the Bluff and 4th of July areas, as well as throughout inner Kachemak Bay. Small troll herring or spoons behind a flasher is the most popular setup, but hootchies and tube flies will also produce fish. To find king salmon at any location, try setting the gear at different depths including mid-water column and 10 feet off the bottom.\n\nSurf fishing anglers were finding success on several of the Cook Inlet beaches last weekend. Anglers are catching a variety of groundfish including halibut, sculpins, skates, sharks, flounders, and cod. Don’t forget about fishing off the tip of the Homer Spit – that location can be productive for a variety of groundfish.\n\nThe king salmon run at the Nick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon is still slow, but some fish are starting to show up. Expect poor fishing throughout the week. Fishing the incoming or outgoing tide is typically your best bet – the tide should be flooding into the lagoon around the +11 ft height. Roe under a bobber, herring, and spinners are all effective methods for king salmon here.\n\nKing salmon fishing has gotten off to a slow start, but anglers were still finding some success fishing at the bridge. Try cured eggs or herring under a slip bobber, or spinners. Incoming tide is the best time to get king salmon at the bridge. High tide is better in the lagoon.\n\n“Please review the emergency orders and advisory announcements below in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip.\n\nAnchor River and Deep Creek Closed to Sport FishingSport Fishing For King Salmon Closed in Upper Cook Inlet Salt WatersKing Salmon Bag Limit Reduced from 2 to 1 in Lower Cook Inlet Salt WatersChanges to King Salmon Gear in the Ninilchik RiverRockfish bag limit reduction: 2 pelagic, 1 non-pelagic.

The hatchery was not able to meet the broodstock goal of 329 king salmon spawning pairs. During a foot survey on July 11, 2024, a peak count of 285 king salmon were counted in Ship Creek. The total escapement for Ship Creek is estimated at 659 king salmon.\n\nOn June 29, 2024, king salmon fishing was closed in Ship Creek from its mouth upstream to a cable 100 feet downstream of the Chugach Power Plant dam.\n\nKing salmon fishing is only open for a youth-only fishery in Campbell Creek during the last weekend in June. A survey was conducted on June 25, 2024, and no king salmon were observed from Old Seward Highway to the Dimond Blvd Bridge prior to the youth-only fishery. Surveys of Campbell Creek were conducted on July 22, 2024, and escapement was estimated at 160 king salmon; the sustainable escapement goal of 340 fish was not achieved.\n\nOn June 27, 2024, king salmon fishing was restricted to no bait and catch and release only for the youth-only fishery occurring on June 29 and 30, 2024.\n\nKing salmon fishing was slow to fair in Whittier and Cordova. Both locations are terminal harvest areas. Throughout the summer and fall, many anglers reported catching king salmon in Valdez Arm. There are no stockings in the Valdez vicinity. No formal surveys are conducted for king salmon in Prince William Sound.\n\nNo management actions were implemented during the 2024 sport fishery season.\n\nKing salmon fishing was fair to good in Resurrection Bay. Angler reports indicated that the king salmon fishing in Resurrection Bay was slow and that fish seemed to be returning later and in lower numbers.\n\nOn June 26, 2024, the youth-only fishery for king salmon in the Seward Lagoon and Outfall stream was extended through July 31, 2024, to allow additional harvest opportunity.\n\nAnglers reported good sockeye salmon fishing in Resurrection Bay but a more condensed season. On June 18, 2024, 10,761 sockeye salmon passed through the Bear Creek weir, with fair numbers of sockeye salmon still entering the river at that time. Bear Lake sockeye salmon have a sustainable escapement goal (SEG) of 700 - 8,300 fish and is managed to escape 12,200 sockeye salmon, which meets both the SEG and the Trail Lakes Hatchery broodstock requirements. The final escapement (excluding broodstock) was approximately 12,564 sockeye salmon.\n\nOn June 21, 2024, in marine waters of Resurrection Bay north of a line from Caines Head to the north point of Thumb Cove and the freshwaters open to sockeye salmon fishing, the bag and possession limits for sockeye salmon were increased to twelve fish.\n\nSockeye salmon fishing in the Coghill River was reported as fair to good this season. The final weir count on July 27, 2024 was 90,196 sockeye salmon through the Coghill River weir. The sockeye salmon SEG for the Coghill River is 20,000 - 75,000 fish.\n\nOn July 3, 2024, the Coghill River drainage sockeye salmon bag limits were increased 12 fish and possession limit of 24 fish. In addition, the fishing area was increased to within 50 feet of the weir.\n\nCoho salmon fishing in Ship Creek this season was poor. The William Jack Hernandez Sport Fish Hatchery collected 740 coho salmon for broodstock and achieved the egg-take goals needed to replace Ship Creek coho salmon broodstock and for stocking terminal fisheries. Multiple surveys were conducted by Division of Sport Fish staff in Ship Creek this season to monitor coho salmon returns. High water made surveys difficult in early August.\n\nOn August 14, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to one fish in Ship Creek and only unbaited, artificial lures allowed from its mouth upstream to a cable 100 feet downstream of the Chugach Power Plant dam.\n\nEffective August 24 through September 30, 2024, coho salmon fishing was closed on Ship Creek.\n\nCoho salmon fishing in Anchorage Area streams was poor. Peak stream surveys on Bird, Campbell, and Rabbit creek drainages indicated poor returns on coho salmon. Sport fishing reports were poor.\n\nOn August 14, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to one fish per day, and only unbaited, artificial lures allowed in all streams excluding Bird and Campbell creeks effective through September 30,2024.\n\nCoho salmon fishing in the North Gulf Coast including Resurrection Bay was poor this season for both boat and shore anglers. While coho salmon returning to the Seward Lagoon arrived later in the season, fishing was still poor. Fishing at the mouth of Resurrection River was reportedly poor this season for coho salmon. As of October 17, 693 coho salmon have entered the Bear Creek weir, which will not provide adequate escapement for broodstock goals. Egg takes were conducted with only 60 female coho salmon at the Bear Creek. Escapement surveys were not conducted for coho salmon due to budget cuts.\n\nOn August 21, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to 1 per day and in possession in the North Gulf Coast fresh and salt waters (excluding Resurrection Bay).\n\nOn August 21, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to 3 per day and in possession in Resurrection Bay Terminal Harvest Area.\n\nCoho salmon fishing was poor throughout Prince William Sound. Coho salmon fishing at Fleming Spit was better than previous years but not nearly as good as observations in 2023. It has not been determined yet if broodstock goals have been met by the Valdez Fisheries Development Association (VFDA) and Prince William Sound Aquaculture Corporation hatcheries (PWSAC). Currently the VFDA in Valdez does not have enough coho salmon to meet their egg take goal and PWSAC also may not meet their egg take goals at the Wally Noerenberg hatchery. Egg takes for these locations have not yet occurred. Both Whittier and Cordova are stocked by PWSAC and are terminal harvest areas. In Valdez, coho salmon are stocked by VFDA. No formal surveys are conducted for coho salmon in Prince William Sound, except for on the Copper River Delta.\n\nOn August 19, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to 3 per day and 6 in possession in the Valdez Terminal Harvest Area.\n\nOn August 24, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to 1 per day and in possession in the Prince William Sound Area, excluding the Terminal Harvest Areas.\n\nOn September 13, 2024, the Valdez Terminal Harvest area was closed to fishing for coho salmon through October 31.\n\nCoho salmon fishing on the Copper River Delta was good. Water conditions were variable throughout the season with some high-water events and some normal periods of low fishable water. As of early September, the Copper River Delta coho salmon return was anticipated to meet the SEG of 32,000 - 50,000 fish based on aerial survey counts. The coho salmon return is still being assessed.\n\nNo management actions were implemented during the 2024 sport fishery season.\n\nThe total allowable harvest (TAH) of 117,023 pounds was established from the results of the fall 2023 Prince William Sound shrimp survey. The 2024 guideline harvest level (GHL) for the noncommercial (sport and subsistence) shrimp fishery harvest was established to be 70,214 pounds. This was approximately 30% lower than the TAH and GHL established for the 2023 season. Approximately 4,143 noncommercial permits were issued in 2024. Effort and harvest are assessed post-season after harvest reports are received. Anecdotal reports from permit holders indicate that shrimping was fair to good this season.\n\nA preseason emergency order effective April 15, 2024, reduced the number of allowable noncommercial shrimp pots per person and per vessel to two pots in areas near the ports of Valdez and Whittier, and three pots in outer areas of Prince William Sound.\n\nThe harvest of rockfish has increased and sustainable levels of rockfish harvest are currently unknown. Preliminary stock assessment work was reviewed in spring 2023 and changes in the biological data along with the increased harvest are indicators of a possible change in the population structure of rockfish in this area. In addition, harvest rates of yelloweye rockfish specifically appear to be unsustainable into the future and a seasonal restriction was put in place for the second year in a row to reduce harvest and protect these fish during the period of time that females are gravid and release larvae. The 2024 harvest information will not be finalized until the fall of 2025.\n\nEffective April 1 â€“ June 30, 2024, no retention of yelloweye rockfish was allowed in the Prince William Sound Management Area.\n\nEffective April 1 â€“ December 31, the bag and possession limit for all rockfish was reduced to 3 per day and 6 in possession.\n\nThe harvest of rockfish has increased, and sustainable levels of rockfish harvest are currently unknown. Preliminary stock assessment work was reviewed in spring 2023 and changes in the biological data along with the increased harvest are indicators of a possible change in the population structure of rockfish in this area. The 2024 harvest information will not be finalized until the fall of 2025.\n\nDue to Board of Fisheries regulatory action, effective January 1 â€“ December 31, 2024, the bag and possession limit for rockfish was reduced to 3 per day and 6 in possession."

Surveys of Campbell Creek were conducted on July 22, 2024, and escapement was estimated at 160 king salmon; the sustainable escapement goal of 340 fish was not achieved.\n\nOn June 27, 2024, king salmon fishing was restricted to no bait and catch and release only for the youth-only fishery occurring on June 29 and 30, 2024.\n\nKing salmon fishing was slow to fair in Whittier and Cordova. Both locations are terminal harvest areas. Throughout the summer and fall, many anglers reported catching king salmon in Valdez Arm. There are no stockings in the Valdez vicinity. No formal surveys are conducted for king salmon in Prince William Sound.\n\nNo management actions were implemented during the 2024 sport fishery season.\n\nKing salmon fishing was fair to good in Resurrection Bay. Angler reports indicated that the king salmon fishing in Resurrection Bay was slow and that fish seemed to be returning later and in lower numbers.\n\nOn June 26, 2024, the youth-only fishery for king salmon in the Seward Lagoon and Outfall stream was extended through July 31, 2024, to allow additional harvest opportunity.\n\nAnglers reported good sockeye salmon fishing in Resurrection Bay but a more condensed season. On June 18, 2024, 10,761 sockeye salmon passed through the Bear Creek weir, with fair numbers of sockeye salmon still entering the river at that time. Bear Lake sockeye salmon have a sustainable escapement goal (SEG) of 700 - 8,300 fish and is managed to escape 12,200 sockeye salmon, which meets both the SEG and the Trail Lakes Hatchery broodstock requirements. The final escapement (excluding broodstock) was approximately 12,564 sockeye salmon.\n\nOn June 21, 2024, in marine waters of Resurrection Bay north of a line from Caines Head to the north point of Thumb Cove and the freshwaters open to sockeye salmon fishing, the bag and possession limits for sockeye salmon were increased to twelve fish.\n\nSockeye salmon fishing in the Coghill River was reported as fair to good this season. The final weir count on July 27, 2024 was 90,196 sockeye salmon through the Coghill River weir. The sockeye salmon SEG for the Coghill River is 20,000 - 75,000 fish.\n\nOn July 3, 2024, the Coghill River drainage sockeye salmon bag limits were increased 12 fish and possession limit of 24 fish. In addition, the fishing area was increased to within 50 feet of the weir.\n\nCoho salmon fishing in Ship Creek this season was poor. The William Jack Hernandez Sport Fish Hatchery collected 740 coho salmon for broodstock and achieved the egg-take goals needed to replace Ship Creek coho salmon broodstock and for stocking terminal fisheries. Multiple surveys were conducted by Division of Sport Fish staff in Ship Creek this season to monitor coho salmon returns. High water made surveys difficult in early August.\n\nOn August 14, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to one fish in Ship Creek and only unbaited, artificial lures allowed from its mouth upstream to a cable 100 feet downstream of the Chugach Power Plant dam.\n\nEffective August 24 through September 30, 2024, coho salmon fishing was closed on Ship Creek.\n\nCoho salmon fishing in Anchorage Area streams was poor. Peak stream surveys on Bird, Campbell, and Rabbit creek drainages indicated poor returns on coho salmon. Sport fishing reports were poor.\n\nOn August 14, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to one fish per day, and only unbaited, artificial lures allowed in all streams excluding Bird and Campbell creeks effective through September 30,2024.\n\nCoho salmon fishing in the North Gulf Coast including Resurrection Bay was poor this season for both boat and shore anglers. While coho salmon returning to the Seward Lagoon arrived later in the season, fishing was still poor. Fishing at the mouth of Resurrection River was reportedly poor this season for coho salmon. As of October 17, 693 coho salmon have entered the Bear Creek weir, which will not provide adequate escapement for broodstock goals. Egg takes were conducted with only 60 female coho salmon at the Bear Creek. Escapement surveys were not conducted for coho salmon due to budget cuts.\n\nOn August 21, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to 1 per day and in possession in the North Gulf Coast fresh and salt waters (excluding Resurrection Bay).\n\nOn August 21, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to 3 per day and in possession in Resurrection Bay Terminal Harvest Area.\n\nCoho salmon fishing was poor throughout Prince William Sound. Coho salmon fishing at Fleming Spit was better than previous years but not nearly as good as observations in 2023. It has not been determined yet if broodstock goals have been met by the Valdez Fisheries Development Association (VFDA) and Prince William Sound Aquaculture Corporation hatcheries (PWSAC). Currently the VFDA in Valdez does not have enough coho salmon to meet their egg take goal and PWSAC also may not meet their egg take goals at the Wally Noerenberg hatchery. Egg takes for these locations have not yet occurred. Both Whittier and Cordova are stocked by PWSAC and are terminal harvest areas. In Valdez, coho salmon are stocked by VFDA. No formal surveys are conducted for coho salmon in Prince William Sound, except for on the Copper River Delta.\n\nOn August 19, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to 3 per day and 6 in possession in the Valdez Terminal Harvest Area.\n\nOn August 24, 2024, the coho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced to 1 per day and in possession in the Prince William Sound Area, excluding the Terminal Harvest Areas.\n\nOn September 13, 2024, the Valdez Terminal Harvest area was closed to fishing for coho salmon through October 31.\n\nCoho salmon fishing on the Copper River Delta was good. Water conditions were variable throughout the season with some high-water events and some normal periods of low fishable water. As of early September, the Copper River Delta coho salmon return was anticipated to meet the SEG of 32,000 - 50,000 fish based on aerial survey counts. The coho salmon return is still being assessed.\n\nNo management actions were implemented during the 2024 sport fishery season.\n\nThe total allowable harvest (TAH) of 117,023 pounds was established from the results of the fall 2023 Prince William Sound shrimp survey. The 2024 guideline harvest level (GHL) for the noncommercial (sport and subsistence) shrimp fishery harvest was established to be 70,214 pounds. This was approximately 30% lower than the TAH and GHL established for the 2023 season. Approximately 4,143 noncommercial permits were issued in 2024. Effort and harvest are assessed post-season after harvest reports are received. Anecdotal reports from permit holders indicate that shrimping was fair to good this season.\n\nA preseason emergency order effective April 15, 2024, reduced the number of allowable noncommercial shrimp pots per person and per vessel to two pots in areas near the ports of Valdez and Whittier, and three pots in outer areas of Prince William Sound.\n\nThe harvest of rockfish has increased and sustainable levels of rockfish harvest are currently unknown. Preliminary stock assessment work was reviewed in spring 2023 and changes in the biological data along with the increased harvest are indicators of a possible change in the population structure of rockfish in this area. In addition, harvest rates of yelloweye rockfish specifically appear to be unsustainable into the future and a seasonal restriction was put in place for the second year in a row to reduce harvest and protect these fish during the period of time that females are gravid and release larvae. The 2024 harvest information will not be finalized until the fall of 2025.\n\nEffective April 1 â€“ June 30, 2024, no retention of yelloweye rockfish was allowed in the Prince William Sound Management Area.\n\nEffective April 1 â€“ December 31, the bag and possession limit for all rockfish was reduced to 3 per day and 6 in possession.\n\nThe harvest of rockfish has increased, and sustainable levels of rockfish harvest are currently unknown. Preliminary stock assessment work was reviewed in spring 2023 and changes in the biological data along with the increased harvest are indicators of a possible change in the population structure of rockfish in this area. The 2024 harvest information will not be finalized until the fall of 2025.\n\nDue to Board of Fisheries regulatory action, effective January 1 â€“ December 31, 2024, the bag and possession limit for rockfish was reduced to 3 per day and 6 in possession."

This year marks the fifth year of king salmon management under the four stock-based goals set for the Susitna River drainage (Deshka, Yentna, Eastside, and Talkeetna). The preseason forecast of total run for Deshka River king salmon was 6,671 fish. Given this forecast was below the low end of the BEG and that the escapement goal was missed in 2023, the Deshka king salmon fishery started the 2024 season closed, as did fisheries within the Talkeetna, Yentna, Little Susitna, and Eastside Susitna areas. King salmon escapement goals for all systems were missed in 2024.\n\nThe BEG for the Deshka River of 9,000–18,000 king salmon was not achieved in 2024 despite the sport fishery remaining closed throughout the season. The final weir count was 3,440 king salmon. The age composition of the Deshka king salmon run and forecast for the 2024 season is pending analysis of age data collected at the Deshka River weir. A complete sonar count was conducted for Lake Creek and aerial escapement surveys were flown in late July on five streams contributing to the Yentna king salmon stock: Talachulitna River, Red Creek, Canyon Creek, Dickerson Creek, and Red Salmon Creek. Assessment of whether the Yentna OEG of 16,000–22,000 king salmon was achieved is pending data analysis; however, aerial counts were well below average, and the Lake Creek sonar count was similar to 2023.\n\nA preseason emergency order effective May 1, 2024, closed king salmon fishing in the Susitna River drainage. Gear was restricted to only one unbaited, single hook, with a gap between the point and shank of the hook of one-half inch or less when fishing in Units 1–6 of the Susitna River drainage.\n\nAssessment of Eastside Susitna streams (Units 2, 3, 5, and 6) comes from postseason aerial surveys over eight streams that are used to estimate run size and escapement of the Eastside (Unit 2 streams along the Parks Highway) king salmon stock and the Talkeetna River stock, which are two of the four Susitna River drainage stock goals in place since 2020. Counts were successfully conducted on Willow, North Fork, Kashwitna, and Montana Creeks, which collectively contribute to the Eastside king stock, and Clear and Prairie Creeks, which contribute to the Talkeetna stock. Assessment of the Eastside and Talkeetna stock goals is pending data analysis; however, counts on these systems were some of the lowest on record. A survey count of 272 on the Chulitna River was well below the SEG of 1,200–2,900 fish.\n\nA preseason emergency order effective May 1, 2024, closed king salmon fishing on Eastside Susitna (Unit 2), the Talkeetna River (Unit 5), and the Chulitna River (Unit 6). Gear was restricted to only one unbaited, single-hook, artificial lure with a gap between the point and shank of the hook of one-half inch or less.\n\nThe SEG for the Little Susitna River is 2,100–4,300 king salmon as assessed by weir and 700–1,500 fish as assessed by postseason aerial survey. This weir-based goal is the primary goal used for assessing escapement unless flooding or some other event results in an incomplete weir count. Use of video at this site has enabled fish to be counted even during periods of high spring runoff when water clarity is poor, which was the case throughout most of the 2024 season. Cold water temperatures likely impeded upstream migration of king salmon followed by flooding that occurred for 6 days mid-June, which made assessment of run strength using weir counts difficult. However, daily counts after recovery of the weir following the flooding were below past years in which the goal was achieved. The sport fishery was closed by preseason emergency order. The final weir count of 1,013 is considered incomplete.\n\nA preseason emergency order effective May 1, 2024, closed king salmon fishing in the Little Susitna River drainage. In addition, only one unbaited, single-hook, artificial lure with a gap between the point and shank of the hook of one-half inch or less in the waters normally open to king salmon fishing.\n\nSport fisheries on the Chuitna, Theodore, Lewis, and the Beluga River drainages are closed by regulation. An aerial survey was conducted on the Chuitna River in which 402 king salmon were counted, well below the SEG of 1,000–1,500 fish. The 2024 surveys of the Theodore River and Coal Creek counted only 33 and 38 king salmon, respectively.\n\nA preseason emergency order effective May 1, 2024, closed king salmon fishing on all West Cook Inlet streams not already closed by regulation.\n\nA weir was operated to count sockeye salmon escapement into Larson Lake, which drains into the Talkeetna River via Larson Creek (Susitna River drainage). Weirs on Chelatna Lake (Lake Creek) and Judd Lake (Talachulitna River) were not operated this year due to budget reductions. On Larson Creek, the sport fishery, which occurs at the confluence of Larsen Creek and the Talkeetna River, is relatively close to the weir, allowing for timely inseason management of the fishery. Water levels were favorable toward consistent daily fish passage and fishing success throughout the season. The Larson Creek SEG of 15,000–35,000 sockeye salmon was achieved with a final count of 16,133 fish within the SEG range.\n\nA Susitna River personal use dip net fishery was implemented by the Board of Fisheries in 2020 to take place on the lower Susitna River from a point located approximately one mile below the old Susitna Station, downstream to the Alexander Creek turnoff/tip of Bell Island. This fishery is remote and only accessible by boat or short field performance aircraft capable of landing on gravel bars. The fishery is part of the Upper Cook Inlet Personal Use Salmon Fishery management plan and occurs each Saturday and Wednesday between 6:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. from July 10 through July 31. This was the fourth year of this fishery. Fishing effort mostly mirrored last season with relatively low participation. Fishing success was reported as poor each period through the end of July.\n\nNo management actions were implemented during the 2024 season.\n\nA weir is operated on Fish Creek to assess escapement and as a tool to manage the personal use dip net fishery. The SEG for the Fish Creek is 15,000–45,000 sockeye salmon. By management plan, a personal use dip net fishery may be opened by emergency order between July 15 and July 31, if the escapement is projected to be above 35,000 fish. The dip net fishery was opened on July 20 for 11 days. Positive dipnetting reports combined with a strong run suggests the harvest estimate may be average to above average for 2024 (5-year mean harvest of 22,500 sockeye salmon). The weir was successfully operated throughout the run and 37,793 sockeye salmon were counted. Sport fishing was open for 7 days a week beginning this season, a change made at the last Board of Fisheries meeting.\n\nOn July 20, the Fish Creek Personal Use Dip Net Fishery was opened for all salmon species, except king salmon through July 31.\n\nFlooding prevented counting fish at the Deshka River weir during the season for six days beginning August 9, and the weir sustained major damage ending the weir project on August 16 after counting about 70% of the run based on historical run timing. The count of 642 coho salmon is considered incomplete, but it is unlikely the SEG of 10,200–24,100 fish would have been achieved. An emergency order was issued in August to close the Deshka River to the retention of coho salmon and prohibit the use of bait in all other waters of the Susitna River drainage.\n\nOn August 6, the bag limit for coho salmon was reduced to one fish and bait was prohibited in the Susitna River drainage.\n\nOn August 15, the Susitna drainage was closed to fishing for coho salmon.\n\nThe Little Susitna weir was inundated by flood waters at the beginning of the season from spring snow melt. However, when the weir became functional again starting June 22, it is unlikely any coho salmon were missed. Initially, weir counts were favorable and produced an upward trending projection; however counts drastically trailed off by the first quartile of the run on August 6. At this time, an emergency order was issued prohibiting the use of bait, followed by closure of the sport fishery to the retention of coho salmon. Beginning August 8, heavy rainfall led to high water events and a lost weir counts for eighteen days. Also, . The weir count of 964 fish is considered incomplete; however, it is likely the SEG of 9,200–17,700 was missed in 2024.\n\nFish Creek weir operated for the full coho salmon season. The SEG of 1,200–6,000 fish was not attained with a final count of 235 fish. This count was complete.\n\nJim Creek weir was funded to operate this season. A weak showing of coho salmon prompted closing the sport fishery to coho salmon fishing by mid-August at about the quarter point of the historical run timing for coho salmon. In addition to Jim Creek, Cottonwood, Fish and Wasilla Creeks were all closed to sport fishing for coho on August 15. Weir counts up to this point were tracking well below years when the weir was operated and the goal was achieved and similar to the count by this time during 2016 when the SEG was missed. The SEG for Jim Creek of 250–700 coho salmon is assessed postseason by a foot survey of McRoberts Creek, a small spawning tributary within the Jim Creek system. A survey conducted on September 23 counted 376 coho salmon, which was within the goal range.\n\nOn August 6, bait use was prohibited on the Little Susitna River and Jim Creek drainage.\n\nOn August 6, the bag and possession limit was reduced to one coho salmon on the Little Susitna River, and Jim Creek.\n\nOn August 15, the Little Susitna River was closed to coho salmon fishing.\n\nOn August 15, Jim Creek, Cottonwood Creek, Wasilla Creek and Fish Creeks were closed to coho fishing.\n\nCoho salmon escapement is not monitored on West Cook Inlet (WCI) area streams and ADF&G must rely on trends in harvest and angler effort taken from the Statewide Harvest Survey and reports from anglers and guides when assessing these stocks. Sport fishing success was reportedly poor for the 2024 season.\n\nOn August 24, West Cook Inlet streams were restricted to two per day and four in possession for coho salmon.\n\nSee the printable PDF version, which includes a table of Region II Escapement Goals and Escapements - including some prior years."

    "full_text": "PDF of Summary, which includes tables of Escapement Goals and Escapements - including some prior years.\n\nThe 2024 outlook for early-run Kenai River king salmon was below average, with a large fish (>75 cm mid eye to tail fork length or greater than about 34 inches in total length) forecast of 2,630 fish. The 2024 forecasted total run was less than the optimal escapement goal (OEG) of 3,900–6,600 large fish, which resulted in preseason closures to the sport fishery. The total estimated passage through June 30, 2024, at the river mile 14 sonar was 1,365 large king salmon, and because of the fishery closure, preliminary spawning escapement and total run estimates are both 1,365 large early-run king salmon. The run exhibited generally low abundance across all age classes and is the second lowest run in the historical data set. The mid-point of the run occurred on June 14, which is two days late when compared to the historical mid-point.\n\nPreliminary age composition estimates from length groups show a noticeably low presence of ocean-age-four fish but overall, there was a low abundance of all age classes.\n\nNeither the OEG of 3,900–6,600 large fish nor the sustainable escapement goal (SEG) of 2,800–5,600 large fish were achieved in 2024. However, the SEG has been achieved or exceeded in four of the last seven years, and the OEG has been achieved or exceeded in three of the last seven years.\n\nA preseason emergency order effective May 1, 2024, closed king salmon fishing from the Kenai River mouth upstream to the outlet of Skilak Lake until June 30.\n\nRiver mile 8.6 netting assessment (preliminary)\n\nApproximately 34% were large fish or ≥75 cm in total length.\n\nSex ratio of large fish ≥75 cm was 26% male and 74% female.\n\nSampled king salmon of all sizes were predominately ocean-age 2 fish (49%), followed by ocean-age 3 fish (31%), ocean-age 1 (14%), and ocean-age 4 fish (6%).\n\nThe outlook for late-run Kenai River king salmon in 2024 was well below average, with a large king salmon (>75 cm mid eye to tail fork length) forecast of approximately 13,639 fish. The 2024 forecasted total run was less than the optimal escapement goal (OEG) of 15,000–30,000 fish so the fishery started closed. The total estimated passage through August 19, 2024, at the river mile 14 sonar was 6,984 large king salmon, and the preliminary escapement is 6,959 large fish (accounts for spawning downriver of the sonar). The mid-point of the run occurred on July 29, which is two days later than the mean historical mid-point.\n\nThe predominate age class for all sizes of Kenai River late-run king salmon are ocean-age 2 (39.5%), followed by ocean-age 3 (29.8%), ocean-age 4 fish (20.2%), and ocean-age 1 (10.5%). The low abundance of large fish age classes (ocean ages 3 and 4) indicates poor production from the 2017, 2018, and 2019 parent years and corresponds with the overall low abundance of the 2024 return.\n\nThe OEG of 15,000–30,000 large fish and SEG of 13,500–27,000 large fish were not achieved in 2024. The SEG has been achieved in one of the last seven years and the OEG has not been achieved since it was created in 2020. Additionally, Kenai River late-run king salmon were designated a Stock of Concern at the Alaska Board of Fisheries March 2024 meeting. The action plan developed to recover Kenai River late-run king salmon includes a recovery goal of 14,250–30,000 large king salmon that is the department’s management objective until the stock recovers. The recovery goal was not achieved in 2024.\n\nA preseason emergency order effective July 1, 2024, closed king salmon fishing from the Kenai River mouth upstream to the outlet of Skilak Lake.\n\nOn August 12, 2024 multiple hooks were prohibited from the mouth of the Kenai River upstream to the Moose River confluence to reduce incidental catches of king salmon while fishing for other species.\n\nOn August 16, 2023 the prohibition of bait and multiple hooks was extended from the mouth of the Kenai River \r\n    upstream to the outlet of Skilak Lake to reduce incidental catches of king salmon while fishing for other species.\n\nRiver mile 8.6 netting assessment (preliminary)Approximately 46% of king salmon were >75 cm in total length.Sex ratios for large fish >75 cm was 77% male and 23% female.Table 1.

The naturally-produced (non-adipose finclipped) component of the Crooked Creek early-run king salmon run is managed to achieve a SEG of 700–1,400 king salmon. The estimated escapement of naturally-produced king salmon was 550 fish for the 2024 season. The egg take goal for future stocking of Crooked Creek was 25 pairs of naturally-produced king salmon of which 20 pairs were spawned in 2024.Management ActionsA preseason emergency order effective May 1, 2024, prohibited the retention of naturally-produced king salmon and the use of multiple hooks.A pre-season emergency order effective May 1, 2024, restricted the use of bait until May 16, 2024.June 19, 2024, an emergency order was issued to restrict gear to single hook, artificial lure, or fly from the Kasilof River’s mouth to the outlet of Tustumena Lake. The emergency order also reduced the bag limit of hatchery-produced king salmon to one from July 1, 2024 to July 31, 2024.July 11, 2024, an emergency order was issued to close the king salmon fishery on the Kasilof River downstream of the Sterling Highway bridge effective July 15, 2024.July, 31, 2024, an emergency order was issued prohibiting the use of bait and restricting to single-hook, artificial lure or fly from the river’s mouth to the outlet of Tustumena lake.Sockeye SalmonKenai RiverThe 2024 Upper Cook Inlet (UCI) sockeye salmon forecast projected a total run of 5.72 million fish: 3.38 million fish to the Kenai River, 1.12 million fish to the Kasilof River, with the remaining fish comprising stocks from Susitna River, Fish Creek, and unmonitored systems. Based on the preseason forecast, the sockeye salmon run was managed on the middle tier for runs of 2.3–4.6 million Kenai River sockeye salmon, with an inriver goal of 1.1–1.4 million sockeye salmon. On July 27, 2024, ADF&G projected the total Kenai River sockeye salmon run to be 2.96 million fish and the department continued to manage for the middle tier with an inriver goal of 1.1–1.4 million sockeye salmon. The preliminary inriver sonar passage estimate was 1,926,350 sockeye salmon. Subtracting the recent 10-year average harvest upstream of the sonar (387,757 fish) produces a preliminary escapement estimate of 1,538,593 sockeye salmon, which exceeds the sockeye salmon SEG 750,000–1.30 million fish. Final estimates will be available when the 2024 Statewide Harvest Survey is completed in the fall of 2025.Management ActionsGeneral regulations adopted a bag limit of 6 fish per day, 12 fish in possession for sockeye salmon from June 20 to August 15, 2024.Russian River - Early RunThe escapement goal for Russian River early-run sockeye salmon is a biological escapement goal (BEG) of 22,000–42,000 fish. The weir count on July 14, 2024, was 34,697 sockeye salmon.Management ActionsOn June 1, 2024, the Russian River Sanctuary Area opened early for sport fishing.Russian River - Late RunThe escapement goal for Russian River late-run sockeye salmon is an SEG of 44,000–85,000 fish. The final Russian River weir count on September 3, 2024, was 70,009 sockeye salmon.Management ActionsNo in season management actions were taken during the Russian River sockeye salmon late run 2024.Kasilof RiverThe forecast for Kasilof River sockeye salmon was 1,115,161 fish. Kasilof River sockeye salmon are managed to achieve an OEG of 140,000–370,000 fish. The sockeye salmon sonar enumerated salmon passage through August 22, 2024, with a preliminary estimate of 1,048,092 fish.Management ActionsOn June 25, 2024, sockeye salmon limits were increased in all portions of the Kasilof River open to salmon fishing to six per day, twelve in possession.Coho SalmonKenai RiverKenai River coho salmon are not monitored for abundance in season and are managed through angler reporting, observations, and conservative general regulation. Angler reports indicated that coho salmon were entering the river in the beginning of August but the abundance seemed poor based on success rates. September reports indicated a mix of angler success but generally, the abundance seemed to remain low in the Kenai River.Management ActionsOn August 21, 2024, an emergency order was issued to reduce the limit for coho salmon in the Kenai River to a bag and possession limit of one fish, effective Saturday, August 24, through Saturday, August 31, 2024; and a bag and possession limit of two coho salmon Sunday, September 1 through Saturday, November 30, 2024.On September 17, 2024, an emergency order was issued to reduce the bag and possession limit for coho salmon 16 inches or greater in length in the Kenai River to one fish; and restrict gear to one unbaited, single hook, artificial lure in the Kenai River from its mouth upstream to the regulatory marker at the outlet of Skilak Lake.Personal Use Dipnet FisheriesKasilof River and Kenai RiverHarvest and participation information for the 2024 season are currently being compiled and will be available this coming winter. The Kasilof River set gill net personal use fishery was delayed by emergency order to reduce mortality of Kenai River bound king salmon from June 11, 2024 to June 19, 2024. The Kasilof River dipnet fishery was open by regulation from June 25 through August 7, 2024. The area open to dipnetting was expanded for the Kasilof fishery on June 25. The Kenai River dipnet fishery opened by regulation on July 10 through July 31, with no retention of king salmon allowed by regulation.Harvest ReportsBeginning in 2024 harvest reporting was required to be submitted online by August 31, 2024Management ActionsOn June 11, 2024, the Kasilof River personal use set gillnet fishery was closed until June 19, 2024.On June 25, 2024, the Kasilof River personal use dipnetting area was expanded. Dipnetting from shore was allowed from ADF&G markers located on Cook Inlet beaches upstream to ADF&G markers at approximately river mile four of the Kasilof River.On July 16, 2024, The Kenai River Personal Use Dip Net fishery was opened 24 hours per day until the season closure.See the printable PDF version, which includes a table of Region II Escapement Goals and Escapements - including some prior years.\n\nApproximately 46% of king salmon were >75 cm in total length.\n\nSex ratios for large fish >75 cm was 77% male and 23% female.\n\nIn June 2024, approximately 98,436 king salmon smolt were stocked into Crooked Creek to enhance recreational sport fishing opportunity in the Kasilof River. The naturally-produced (non-adipose finclipped) component of the Crooked Creek early-run king salmon run is managed to achieve a SEG of 700–1,400 king salmon. The estimated escapement of naturally-produced king salmon was 550 fish for the 2024 season. The egg take goal for future stocking of Crooked Creek was 25 pairs of naturally-produced king salmon of which 20 pairs were spawned in 2024.\n\nA preseason emergency order effective May 1, 2024, prohibited the retention of naturally-produced king salmon and the use of multiple hooks.\n\nA pre-season emergency order effective May 1, 2024, restricted the use of bait until May 16, 2024.\n\nJune 19, 2024, an emergency order was issued to restrict gear to single hook, artificial lure, or fly from the Kasilof River’s mouth to the outlet of Tustumena Lake. The emergency order also reduced the bag limit of hatchery-produced king salmon to one from July 1, 2024 to July 31, 2024.\n\nJuly 11, 2024, an emergency order was issued to close the king salmon fishery on the Kasilof River downstream of the Sterling Highway bridge effective July 15, 2024.\n\nJuly, 31, 2024, an emergency order was issued prohibiting the use of bait and restricting to single-hook, artificial lure or fly from the river’s mouth to the outlet of Tustumena lake.\n\nThe 2024 Upper Cook Inlet (UCI) sockeye salmon forecast projected a total run of 5.72 million fish: 3.38 million fish to the Kenai River, 1.12 million fish to the Kasilof River, with the remaining fish comprising stocks from Susitna River, Fish Creek, and unmonitored systems. Based on the preseason forecast, the sockeye salmon run was managed on the middle tier for runs of 2.3–4.6 million Kenai River sockeye salmon, with an inriver goal of 1.1–1.4 million sockeye salmon. On July 27, 2024, ADF&G projected the total Kenai River sockeye salmon run to be 2.96 million fish and the department continued to manage for the middle tier with an inriver goal of 1.1–1.4 million sockeye salmon. The preliminary inriver sonar passage estimate was 1,926,350 sockeye salmon. Subtracting the recent 10-year average harvest upstream of the sonar (387,757 fish) produces a preliminary escapement estimate of 1,538,593 sockeye salmon, which exceeds the sockeye salmon SEG 750,000–1.30 million fish. Final estimates will be available when the 2024 Statewide Harvest Survey is completed in the fall of 2025.\n\nGeneral regulations adopted a bag limit of 6 fish per day, 12 fish in possession for sockeye salmon from June 20 to August 15, 2024.\n\nThe escapement goal for Russian River early-run sockeye salmon is a biological escapement goal (BEG) of 22,000–42,000 fish. The weir count on July 14, 2024, was 34,697 sockeye salmon.\n\nOn June 1, 2024, the Russian River Sanctuary Area opened early for sport fishing.\n\nThe escapement goal for Russian River late-run sockeye salmon is an SEG of 44,000–85,000 fish. The final Russian River weir count on September 3, 2024, was 70,009 sockeye salmon.\n\nNo in season management actions were taken during the Russian River sockeye salmon late run 2024.\n\nThe forecast for Kasilof River sockeye salmon was 1,115,161 fish. Kasilof River sockeye salmon are managed to achieve an OEG of 140,000–370,000 fish. The sockeye salmon sonar enumerated salmon passage through August 22, 2024, with a preliminary estimate of 1,048,092 fish.\n\nOn June 25, 2024, sockeye salmon limits were increased in all portions of the Kasilof River open to salmon fishing to six per day, twelve in possession.\n\nKenai River coho salmon are not monitored for abundance in season and are managed through angler reporting, observations, and conservative general regulation. Angler reports indicated that coho salmon were entering the river in the beginning of August but the abundance seemed poor based on success rates. September reports indicated a mix of angler success but generally, the abundance seemed to remain low in the Kenai River.\n\nOn August 21, 2024, an emergency order was issued to reduce the limit for coho salmon in the Kenai River to a bag and possession limit of one fish, effective Saturday, August 24, through Saturday, August 31, 2024; and a bag and possession limit of two coho salmon Sunday, September 1 through Saturday, November 30, 2024.\n\nOn September 17, 2024, an emergency order was issued to reduce the bag and possession limit for coho salmon 16 inches or greater in length in the Kenai River to one fish; and restrict gear to one unbaited, single hook, artificial lure in the Kenai River from its mouth upstream to the regulatory marker at the outlet of Skilak Lake.\n\nHarvest and participation information for the 2024 season are currently being compiled and will be available this coming winter. The Kasilof River set gill net personal use fishery was delayed by emergency order to reduce mortality of Kenai River bound king salmon from June 11, 2024 to June 19, 2024. The Kasilof River dipnet fishery was open by regulation from June 25 through August 7, 2024. The area open to dipnetting was expanded for the Kasilof fishery on June 25.

    "full_text": "The king salmon escapement fell below the biological escapement goal (BEG) of 4,800 - 8,400 fish with a weir count of 394 king salmon. The mid-point of the run occurred on June 21, which is similar to historical run timing. The Ayakulik River king salmon run has seen declines since 2006 and was designated as a stock of concern by the Board of Fisheries in 2020. The escapement objectives have been met some years; however, in the most recent years the escapement objectives have not been met and the 2024 weir count was the lowest in recent history.\n\nAA preseason emergency order effective April 1, closed king salmon fishing on the Ayakulik River drainage and only one unbaited, single-hook artificial lure was allowed.\n\nThe king salmon escapement was below the BEG of 3,000 - 6,000 fish with a weir count of just 76 king salmon. The Karluk River king salmon escapement has been below the BEG most of the last 20 years, though the goal was achieved from 2018-2020. The mid-point of the run occurred on June 18, which is similar to historical run-timing. The 2024 weir count was the lowest on record and one of the lowest king salmon returns in the State. The Karluk River has not been open to the harvest of king salmon since 2007 and sport fishing for king salmon has been entirely closed since 2008.\n\nA preseason emergency order effective April 1, closed the Karluk River drainage to sport fishing for king salmon and only one unbaited, single-hook artificial lure was allowed.\n\nThe king salmon escapement fell below the BEG of 1,300 - 2,700 fish with a weir count of 1166 king salmon but was a much improved count over the previous several years. The mid-point of the run occurred on July 20, which is similar to historical run timing. While the Chignik River king salmon run has not seen as prolonged declines as Kodiak Island runs, it fell below the BEG 6 of the last 7 years.\n\nA preseason emergency order was issued effective June 1 to close the Chignik River downstream to Mensis Point for sport fishing for king salmon and restrict tackle to only one unbaited, single-hook artificial lure. On June 13, the area closed in the Chignik River to king salmon fishing and bait and tackle restrictions was expanded to include the entire Chignik Lagoon.\n\nThe weir count for king salmon was 3,542 fish. This was within the BEG of 2,400 - 4,400 salmon. There is no retention in this fishery throughout the season based on regulation. The mid-point of the run occurred on July 5, which is similar to historical run timing.\n\nNo management actions were implemented during the 2024 sport fishery season.\n\nEach year the Olds River, American River, and/or Salonie Creek are stocked with up to 80,000 king salmon smolt. The stocked Kodiak road system streams had low returns again in 2024 and there was little harvest in this fishery. Very few fish were observed at the Olds or at Salonie Creek and no fish at American River. Egg take goals were not met this year with only 5 spawning pairs collected. To compensate for this shortfall, coho salmon will be stocked to supplement king salmon production. The 2024 king salmon egg take should produce about 20,000 smolt and is well below the target of 200,000 king salmon smolt. Coho salmon will be taken again from Pillar Creek in early November to supplement this shortfall.\n\nIn 2024 the upper portions of the Olds River and Salonie Creek were closed byemergency order effective July 11 to all sport fishing to accommodate brood stockcollection for the egg take.\n\nThe early sockeye salmon escapement below the BEG of 150,000 - 250,000 fish with a weir count of 67,743 sockeye salmon. Little harvest occurs upstream of the weir and escapement is likely equal to the weir count.\n\nNo management actions were implemented during the 2024 sport fishery season.\n\nThe early sockeye salmon escapement fell within the BEG of 140,000 - 280,000 fish with a weir count of 221,701 sockeye salmon. An unknown amount of harvest of sockeye salmon occurs above the weir, though it is minimal compared to the size of the run.\n\nNo management actions were implemented during the 2024 sport fishery season.\n\nThe sockeye salmon escapement was within the BEG of 75,000 - 170,000 fish with a count of 78,504 sockeye salmon at the Frazer Lake fish pass.\n\nNo management actions were implemented during the 2024 sport fishery season.\n\nThe sockeye salmon escapement was above the BEG of 5,000 - 8,000 fish with a weir count of 9,704 sockeye salmon. No harvest occurs upstream of the weir which is located just downstream from Buskin Lake and escapement is equal to the weir count. The mid-point of the run occurred on June 29, which is later than historical run-timing.\n\nOn July 3, the bag limit for sockeye salmon was increased to 5 per day by emergency order.\n\nThe sockeye salmon escapement was above the BEG of 15,000 - 35,000 fish with a weir count of 66,110 sockeye salmon. No harvest occurs upstream of the weir and escapement is equal to the weir count. The mid-point of the run occurred on July 24, which is later than historical run timing but similar to the last 5 years. This is the largest freshwater sport fishery on Kodiak by harvest for a single stock and the sockeye salmon run has been above the BEG most of the last 10 years. The 2024 run was still ongoing at the time the weir was pulled in mid-August.\n\nOn July 11, the sockeye salmon bag and possession limits were increased to 10 fish inthe Saltery Cove Drainage by emergency order.\n\nThe sockeye salmon escapement was within the sustainable escapement goal (SEG) of 2,000 to 10,000 fish with a weir count of 7,641 sockeye salmon. No harvest occurs upstream of the weir and escapement is equal to the weir count. The mid-point of the run occurred on July 24, which is later than historical run timing but similar to the previous 5 years. This is the first season using the weir-based SEG versus the aerial survey based SEG and bag limits were able to be liberalized due correspondingly.\n\nOn July 11, the sockeye salmon bag limit was increased to 4 fish per day by emergency order.\n\nOn July 27, the Pasagshak River drainage was reopened to sport fishing for sockeye salmon and bag \r\n    limits were restored.\n\nThe sockeye salmon escapement was within the BEG of 20,000 - 50,000 fish with a weir count of 32,218 sockeye salmon. The mid-point of the run occurred on June 21 which is later than historical run timing but similar to recent years.\n\nNo management actions were implemented during the 2024 sport fishery season.\n\nThe SEG for Buskin River coho salmon is 4,700 - 9,600 fish and the 2024 weir count was 2,238. The mid-point of the run typically occurs in the third week of September, however, the last 5 years have seen much of the Kodiak Road Zone coho salmon escapement in October and it is unknown at this date if the weir count is a complete count. Estimates will continue to be made into October as information is gathered.\n\nNo management actions were implemented during the 2024 sport fishery.\n\nThe lower bound SEG for Olds River coho salmon is 500 fish and the 2024 run is ongoing. The 2024 run appears to be average so far, though no surveys have been conducted to date. The Olds River coho salmon run is assessed via in season drone surveys, though conditions were poor to get reliable survey estimates. Final escapement estimates will be documented via post season foot surveys in late October or November.\n\nNo management actions have been implemented during the 2024 sport fishery season so far.\n\nThe lower bound SEG for American River coho salmon is 400 fish and the 2024 run is weak so far. Foot and drone surveys conducted in late September showed no more than 30 fish in the drainage and the run does not appear it will achieve the SEG. Final escapement estimates will be documented via post season foot surveys in late October or November.\n\nThe American River was closed to coho salmon fishing and the use of bait restricted byemergency order on September 25.\n\nThe lower bound SEG for Pasagshak River coho salmon is 1,200 fish and the 2024 run is ongoing. The 2024 run appears to be average. The latest drone survey counted 2,326 coho salmon in Lake Rose Teed. The Pasagshak River coho salmon run is assessed via in season drone surveys but final escapement estimates will be documented via post season foot surveys in November.\n\nNo management actions have been implemented during the 2024 sport fishery season."

    "full_text": "PDF of Summary, which includes tables of Escapement Goals and Escapements - including some prior years.\n\nThe Anchor River king salmon sustainable escapement goal (SEG) was updated to 3,200–6,400 fish starting in 2024. Additionally, the Alaska Board of Fisheries (BOF) adopted a management plan for the king salmon sport fisheries in the lower Kenai Peninsula roadside streams. This plan outlines preseason and inseason management actions for the Anchor River based on the preseason forecast and inseason projections.\n\nThe 2024 preseason inriver forecast of 2,349 king salmon was below the SEG. With this forecast, the inriver sport fishery was closed preseason based on the management plan. King salmon escapement monitoring transitioned to a new location approximately one mile upstream of the river mouth. This location is just above the intertidal section of the stream and provides for more timely monitoring. Based on inseason projections, it was anticipated that the king salmon run was going to achieve the SEG and the sport fishery was opened on June 15 to catch-and-release fishing for the last four days of the season. The preliminary escapement estimate was 3,331 fish, which met the SEG. The mid-point (June 20) was 14 days early compared to the recent 3-year average mid-point of July 3. The Anchor River king salmon run has met its SEG in two (2021 and 2024) of the last five years.\n\nA preseason emergency order closed the Anchor River and Deep Creek to all sport fishing through July 15.\n\nAn inseason emergency order opened the Anchor River to catch and release king salmon fishing on June 15 for the remaining four days of the season. Gear was restricted to single-hook artificial lure.\n\nThe Ninilchik River king salmon sustainable escapement goal (SEG) was updated to 900–1,600 wild (naturally-produced) fish starting in 2024 based on counts at the lower (river mile 2) weir. Additionally, the Ninilchik River king salmon run is supplemented with hatchery fish. In 2023, the BOF adopted a management plan for the king salmon sport fisheries in the lower Kenai Peninsula roadside streams. This plan outlines preseason management actions for the Ninilchik River, based on the Anchor River forecast, and inseason management actions, based on the Ninilchik River wild and hatchery inseason projections. The BOF also restructured the king salmon sport fishery to be hatchery only by closing the harvest of wild king salmon in regulation, increasing the hatchery bag limit from 1 to 2 fish 20 inches or greater, and restricting gear to single hook with bait or single hook lures. Additionally, the area for the youth-only king salmon fishery was expanded to include an additional mile of stream upstream of the Sterling Highway bridge.\n\nNo preseason forecast was estimated for the 2024 wild Ninilchik River king salmon run. The three 3-day weekend fishery occurred as outlined in the management plan. Effort and success generally increased over the weekends. The youth-only fishery was well attended and many youth anglers caught king salmon. At the start of the continuous fishery on June 16, the catch rates declined, which corresponded with a reduction in the daily passage of king salmon at the lower weir. With this, an emergency order was issued on June 19 to restrict the use of bait for the remainder of king salmon season. Effort tapered off through the remainder of June and success was poor to fair.\n\nThe 2024 Ninilchik River wild king salmon escapement was 676 (after broodstock removals), which was below the lower end of the SEG and was the third consecutive year that the run did not achieve the SEG. The hatchery king salmon count upstream of the sport fishery was 1,298 fish, and after removals for broodstock, the hatchery escapement was 896 fish.\n\nBroodstock collection at the Ninilchik River fell short of both the naturally-produced and hatchery-reared collection goals. Enough naturally-produced fish were collected to continue stocking the Ninilchik River in 2025 at a reduced level. The hatchery-reared collections also fell short at the other broodstock collection locations in Cook Inlet, so reduced numbers of smolt will be available for stocking at locations like Seldovia and the Homer Spit in 2025.\n\nA preseason emergency order restricted the harvest of wild fish and increased the bag and possession limits of hatchery king salmon, 20 inches or greater in length, from one to two fish. The use of multiple hooks and treble hooks was also prohibited.\n\nAn inseason emergency order was issued to restrict the use of bait in the continuous fishery from June 19 through July 15.\n\nThe sport fishery was closed with preseason restrictions based on management actions outlined in the management plan based on the Anchor River management actions. Deep Creek has a SEG of 350 king salmon and is assessed postseason via a single aerial survey. No survey was conducted in 2024 due to a lack of funding.\n\nA preseason emergency order closed the Anchor River and Deep Creek to all sport fishing through July 15.\n\nSport fishing for king salmon in Cook Inlet is structured into the Winter (September 1–March 31) and the Summer (April 1–August 31) Fisheries. The Summer Fishery is separated into two fisheries with the Lower Cook Inlet fishery occurring south of the Bluff Point latitude (lat 59°40.00′ N) and the Upper Cook Inlet (UCI) fishery occurring north. The BOF added some preseason and inseason management actions to the Upper Cook Inlet Summer Fishery management plan based on forecasts and inseason projections for early-run stocks (Deshka, Kenai, and Anchor Rivers). For early-run stocks, the effective dates for the management actions are May 1 through July 15. The BOF also included this fishery into the Kenai River Late Run King Salmon Recovery Plan. In the recovery plan, the Upper Cook Inlet Summer Fishery is closed in regulation from June 20 through August 15. With these changes and the restrictions and closures to freshwater sport fisheries throughout Cook Inlet drainages, sport fishing for king salmon was closed in UCI from May 1 through August 15. For the Lower Cook Inlet (LCI) Summer Fishery, the BOF adopted a management plan and established a Guideline Harvest Level (GHL) of 8,500 fish. No management actions were outlined in the plan. The bag limit was reduced from two to one king salmon any size in LCI from May through August 15, based on the closure in UCI and freshwater restrictions.\n\nThe performance of these fisheries is only assessed postseason with the Statewide Harvest Survey and charter logbook data, and harvest estimates for 2024 will not be available until 2025. For 2023, the SWHS estimates of king salmon harvest for the Summer and Winter Fisheries were all below their respective averages for the past three years. The winter fishery harvest was 3,936 king salmon, which was below the guideline harvest level for the first time since 2013. In 2024, during the winter fishery, anglers found good success in January, but fishing success was lower in February and March. The summer fisheries had poor success from April through mid-May but improved in June and remained fair to good for the remainder of the summer. Anglers consistently found success in the Bluff Point area. At the start of the winter fishery season in September, anglers had good catches throughout Kachemak Bay.\n\nA preseason emergency order effective May 1 closed king salmon fishing in the Cook Inlet salt waters north of the latitude of Bluff Point (lat 59°40.00′ N) through August 15.\n\nA preseason emergency order effective May 1 reduced the king salmon bag and possession limits from two to one fish any size in the Cook Inlet salt waters south of the latitude of Bluff Point (lat 59°40.00′ N) through July 31.\n\nThere are no preseason forecasts and no escapement goals for any coho salmon stocks in the lower Kenai Peninsula roadside streams (Anchor and Ninilchik Rivers, Deep and Stariski Creeks). A video weir was operated on the Anchor River to enumerate coho salmon escapement. The preliminary escapement count was 2,100 fish, which was well below the historical average. Based on below-average inseason counts and fishery performance indicators, most freshwater sport fisheries on the Kenai Peninsula and West Cook Inlet area were restricted. For the lower Kenai Peninsula roadside streams, the coho salmon bag limit was reduced from two to one fish and the use of bait and treble hooks was prohibited starting August 24 and continuing for the remainder of the season.\n\nSport fishing effort was low throughout August on all lower Kenai Peninsula roadside streams and was further reduced towards the end of August with the emergency order restrictions. The Statewide Harvest Survey estimates of harvest for these fisheries will not be available until 2025.\n\nSport fishing for coho salmon in Cook Inlet was poor, and anglers struggled to find concentrations of coho salmon. Most charters reported king salmon were more prevalent than coho salmon throughout July and August. Based on these fisheries performance indicators and the below average coho salmon run to the Anchor River, the coho salmon bag limit was restricted from three to one fish on August 24 through the remainder of the season for Cook Inlet salt waters, excluding the Nick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon. The Statewide Harvest Survey estimates for this fishery will not be available until 2025.\n\nCoho salmon bag and possession limits were reduced by emergency order in Kenai Peninsula fresh waters, West Cook Inlet fresh waters, and Cook Inlet salt waters. Additionally, the use of bait and treble hooks was prohibited in Kenai Peninsula fresh waters. The effective date for these restrictions was from August 24 through the remainder of the season.\n\nIn 2024, the stocking goals were met for Nick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon (NDFL) on the Homer Spit with approximately 315,000 king salmon smolt and 120,000 coho salmon smolt. The Statewide Harvest Survey estimates harvest for these fisheries will not be available until 2025. Overall, the king and coho salmon fisheries were likely below recent average harvests in 2024. Snagging was not opened for either species in 2024 because there was not a sufficient buildup of fish at the end of the run.\n\nNo management actions occurred in 2024.\n\nThe BOF made a couple of regulation changes for the Seldovia king salmon terminal fishery starting in 2024. The waters of the fishery were defined in regulation and were closed to snagging and spear fishing from January 1 through June 23. Generally, the king salmon fishing success in Seldovia was similar to the NDFL and below the recent year’s average performance.\n\nNo management actions occurred in 2024.\n\nThe BOF extended the season dates to start June 15 and continue through August 15 in the China Poot Creek personal use dip net fishery. This fishery does not require a permit for participation; harvest data are now available from the SWHS starting in 2022. The annual harvest estimates ranged from 11,000 fish in 2023 to 25,000 fish in 2022. The harvest estimate for 2024 is not yet available. The Division of Commercial Fisheries conducts weekly foot surveys to count sockeye and pink salmon. Success was fair at the start of the season and water conditions were high in the creek. Success was good for the remainder of the season with most participants easily obtaining limits. The success in this fishery is most likely attributed to changes in commercial fishing and cost recovery operations associated with the stocking.\n\nNo management actions occurred in 2024.\n\nThe harvest of rockfish has increased steadily since 2013, and sustainable levels of rockfish harvest are currently unknown. The sport fishery is monitored with harvest data from the SWHS and Charter Logbook program, and biological data is monitored from the port sampling program in the Homer Harbor. Preliminary stock assessment work was reviewed in spring 2023 and changes in the biological data along with the increased harvest are indicators of a possible change in the population structure of rockfish in this area. Based on these conditions, the BOF reduced the rockfish bag and possession limits to 3 per day and 6 in possession starting in 2024. No harvest has been estimated for 2024 yet. The 2023 rockfish harvest was just over 41,000 fish, which was a 35% reduction from 2022. This reduction was attributed to the emergency order to reduce the bag limit from 5 to 3 fish.\n\nNo management actions occurred in 2024.\n\nAll East Cook Inlet beaches remained closed to sport and personal use clamming for the start of 2024 until abundance surveys could be conducted in the spring. Surveys were conducted in April and May at both Clam Gulch and Ninilchik area beaches. Abundances of adult-sized razor clams at both beaches were below the threshold outlined in the management plan to open the fishery. Additionally, the abundance of juvenile clams at both beaches was below average and not sufficient to improve adult abundances over the next couple of seasons.\n\nNo management actions occurred in 2024.\n\nThe West Cook Inlet beaches remained open to sport and personal use clamming in 2024. Harvest estimates for the sport fishery are not available yet, but clammers report good success at Polly Creek and Crescent River Bar areas, with larger clams found at Crescent River Bar. Based on department hand dug samples, the percentage of large size clams in the harvest is continuing to improve in West Cook Inlet.\n\nNo management actions occurred in 2024.\n\nNo trawl surveys were conducted in 2023 or 2024, so the limited fishery was implemented for both seasons. Just over 2,100 permits were issued for the 2023–2024 season. Of these, 78% reported participating in the fishery and approximately 6% failed to report and will be denied a permit for the 2024–2025 season. For the 2023–2024 season, the harvest was 6,437 male Tanner crabs, which was slightly below the recent year’s average. Permits are only available through ADF&G’s online store for the 2024–2025 season.\n\nNo management actions were implemented for the 2023–2024 fishery season.\n\nSee the printable PDF version, which includes a table of Region II Escapement Goals and Escapements - including some prior years."

Look for new booklets around March or early April.\n\nADF&G does not monitor ice thickness, ice thickness can vary widely from system to system. By mid-November, some lakes may have 5 inches of ice, and some only 1 inch. If you are unsure of the ice thickness, punch a hole near shore and measure before venturing farther on lake ice. Always play it safe. Once lake ice is safe enough for travel (6 inches of clear ice for foot traffic), ice fishing is usually great on the area's many stocked lakes.\n\n* For ice conditions on Municipality of Anchorage lakes, call Municipality Parks and Recreation at (907) 343-4474.* For lake ice and snow pack conditions on Fort Richardson Army Base, try (907) 384-2744* For lake ice and snow pack conditions on Elmendorf Air Force Base, try (907) 552-2282 or 2436.* For ice and snow pack conditions in Chugach State Park, call (907) 345-5014.\n\nAbout a dozen Anchorage area lakes are stocked with catchable-sized Chinook salmon for winter ice fishing, and many lakes still have good populations of rainbows left from summer stocking. Some of the local area lakes stocked for ice fishing include: Beach, Campbell Point (Kincaid Park), Clunie, Delong, Jewel, Mirror and Sand Lakes. Many of these lakes are also stocked during the summer with other popular fish, like grayling, Arctic Char and lake trout to provide anglers with an opportunity catch different species. Anglers can check the status of lake stocking by using the stocking database on our website. The stocked lake database used on our Internet site is usually updated on Thursdays, so check back each Friday to get the latest information. The web pages also have links to maps of the area's stocked lakes, showing the contours of the labeled. Stocked lakes are also listed in the regulation booklet.Lake Fishing: Rainbow Trout\n\nUnless an Emergency Order has been issued, the limit for rainbow trout in stocked lakes and streams is 5 fish per day, and only 1 trout can be over 20 inches. You may have 5 unpreserved rainbow trout in your possession. These fish are typically more difficult to catch through the ice, but fishing improves during the lengthening days of spring.\n\nThese fish are stocked specifically for the winter ice fishery. They are typically about eight inches in length and feed aggressively all winter. Children as young as 2 and 3 years old can these fish. The easiest way to catch these fish is to suspend a small baited jig 5 to 10 feet below a bobber, then move the jig up and down. Fresh shrimp, canned clams, and single salmon eggs work the best as bait. Avoid using corn or other vegetables as bait - these fish cannot quickly digest these items, which will block the digestive tract and slowly kill the fish. The limit for catchable salmon in stocked lakes is 5 fish per day, and you may have only 5 unpreserved landlocked salmon in your possession.\n\nSand and Campbell Point lakes are both stocked with catchable-sized Arctic char, about 8 to 10 inches long. Sometimes, however, a small number of excess “brood” char are also stocked into these two lakes. These brood char are usually about 24 inches long. These fish are also feeding all winter and can be caught by jigging a baited lure just off the bottom of the lake. Swedish Pimples, and Castmaster-like jigs baited with cured salmon eggs are popular char lures. The limit for Dolly Varden/Arctic Char in stocked lakes is 5 per day/5 in possession.\n\nEvery year, ice-fishing anglers are ticketed for having more than their daily limit of fish. Don’t be a statistic! It’s 5 trout and 10 salmon and 5 char per day, NOT PER LAKE/STREAM!\n\nOnly 2 trout per person per day may be kept from lakes or streams that are not stocked.\n\nPike fishing success is great during ice fishing season on Lower Fire Lake. All other Anchorage lakes have been eradicated of pike as they are an introduced species. Jig bright, shiny lures, or swing your decoy. Spearing through a hole in the ice is legal. These fish also become more active during the winter as the days get longer. Females preparing to spawn in the spring feed readily and catch rates tend to increase during the late winter. We appreciate all your help in controlling this illegally introduced species. There is no bag limit for northern pike in Anchorage area waters. If you catch one in any Anchorage area lake besides Lowere Fire Lake, please notify ADF&G Invasive Species Division.  If you don’t want to use the pike you catch, we suggest contacting a local charity to see if they would appreciate a donation of fresh fish. Many pike recipes can be found on the Internet. ADF&G also has a handout with two recipes, as well as pike fishing tips and a listing of all known or suspected pike waters.\n\nPeople who are dumping pike into local waterways are a real threat to your recreational fisheries. Anyone with any information on illegal stockings is encouraged to contact Fish and Wildlife Safeguard at 1-800-478-3377 or State Troopers' Fish and Wildlife Protection at (907) 269-5954 or 269-5541.\n\nIce fishing for rainbow trout and Dolly Varden on Campbell Creek (or any other Anchorage area flowing water) is highly dependent on location. Campbell Creek trout and Dollies probably overwinter in Campbell Lake, which is closed to all fishing. If you know of a deep pool or beaver pond upstream from Campbell Lake, you can try there. Upstream of the forks near Piper Street, no bait is allowed, and you must use single hooks - no treble hooks or multiple hooks. Also upstream of the forks, Campbell Creek is catch-and-release only for rainbows. Daily limits are the same as for stocked lakes October through February."

(Neither the ADF&G Permanent ID license nor the ADF&G Disabled Veteran's license expire.)\n\nThe sport fishing regulations are good through April 15 of the new year. Look for new booklets in late March or early April.\n\nEarly spring ice fishing is slow for landlocked salmon, but can be decent for rainbow trout and pike. You can check the stocking records on our website to find out which lakes were stocked for ice fishing. The web pages also have links to maps of the area’s stocked lakes, showing the contours of the lakebed. You can also find a listing of stocked lakes in the regulation booklet.\n\nAlthough the ice usually does not break up until mid-May, mild winters or unusually warm temperatures may weaken the ice in March and April. Be sure to chop or drill test holes before going out too far on the ice. Once the ice does melt, it usually melts near the shoreline first. Casting over these open water leads towards the edge of the receding ice is usually the avid angler’s first fishing experience of the year.\n\nJigging lures or using bait near drop off areas still works well for rainbow trout and catchable salmon. The more popular baits include fresh (not frozen) cocktail shrimp, single eggs, or preserved egg clusters. For lake trout/char, fish the bottom of the deepest hole you can find. Corn is not recommended, because it can clog up the digestive tract of fish. If you release a fish, or if other fish feed on the corn, they may die. Tossing a few eggshells through the hole helps with visibility.\n\nTravel on the ice is at your own risk. Ice thickness can vary widely from system to system. ADF&G does not monitor ice thickness.

Pike are spring spawners, often spawning under the ice. Before spawning, pike are very active, and actively chase shiny lures and jigs. Head to Lower Fire Lake which is the only lake where pike should be found in Anchorage. Eradication efforts have taken place in all other Anchorage lakes where ADF&G had previously confirmed pike had been introduced. Spearing is legal, as is bow and arrow fishing. The arrow must have a barbed tip, and be attached to the bow by a line.\n\nWe appreciate all your help in controlling this illegally-introduced species. There is no bag limit for northern pike in Anchorage area waters. If you don’t want to use the pike you catch, we suggest contacting a local charity to see if they would appreciate a donation of fresh fish. Many pike recipes can be found on the Internet.

The ice on Campbell Creek is often unsafe in March and April.\n\nOnce open water develops, look for deep pools or beaver ponds, and cast your small lure or fly through those. Fishing success will go down if the water is muddy from snowmelt.\n\nUpstream of the forks near Piper Street, no bait is allowed, and you must use single hooks – no treble hooks or multiple hooks. Also upstream of the forks, Campbell Creek is catch-and-release only for rainbows. Daily limits are the same as for stocked lakes.\n\nAlthough it technically opens April 1, the hooligan run to the Twentymile River usually does not pick up until late April. The run usually peaks in mid- to late May, and the season closes in salt waters on May 31, and June 15 for fresh waters.\n\nAll hooligan runs are very changeable in size and timing. You must be an Alaska resident to use a dipnet to catch hooligan. You must also have your fishing license (or ADF&G Permanent ID Card or ADF&G Disabled Veteran’s Card, as appropriate). Dipping on the rising tide just after a rain usually gives the best success, since hooligan seem to wait for high water. Check your local newspaper for the Anchorage tides, and add about 45 minutes to the high tide time to get the time of high tide at Twentymile.March through April"

Kids under 16 and permanent license holders can get a harvest record card free from most major license vendors. The bag/possession limits for Chinook salmon are 1 per day, or 5 for the entire season. Also, in Ship Creek and Eagle River, once you have harvested a king salmon you may not fish in waters open to king salmon fishing for the remainder of the day.\n\nAll other streams in the Anchorage area are closed to king salmon sport fishing with the exception of a Youth only fishery on Campbell Creek that takes place on the last Saturday and Sunday in June each year. Be sure to check the regulation book for specific details on this fishery.\n\nOnce the spring melt-off is gone and the creeks clear up, rainbow trout and Dolly Varden fishing in Chester and Campbell creeks can be excellent. A few rainbow trout are also available in the middle reaches of Ship Creek. Both Campbell and Chester Creeks are stocked with rainbow trout, and some natural reproduction of stocked rainbows also occurs. Both streams have native populations of Dolly Varden.\n\nBE AWARE: different sections of the same Anchorage area stream may have different gear regulations as well as different bag/possession limits. Check the regulation booklet carefully and know exactly where you are fishing.\n\nHooligan return to Twentymile and Placer rivers in early to mid-May. Runs are often sporadic, with fish waiting for cool, high water to travel upstream.\n\nONLY ALASKAN RESIDENTS with a sport fishing license in their possession can dipnet for hooligan. A long-handled dip net fished at the mouth of Twentymile or Placer rivers or along the rocky beaches jutting out into the southern end of Turnagain Arm provides the best success. Dipping on the rising or flood tide usually produces the best results, and a tide of at least 25 feet as measured at Anchorage is recommended. Dip netting is allowed in saltwater through May 31 and in freshwater through June 15. Gillnets may not be used in Turnagain Arm. Use common sense while pursuing hooligan and do not venture out onto the mud flats.\n\nBy mid- to late May, most Anchorage area lakes are ice free and have been stocked with hatchery-raised rainbow trout. These fish, as well as fish that have over-wintered provide an excellent spring fishing opportunity. A few Anchorage-area lakes receive hatchery-raised Arctic grayling, lake trout, or Arctic char. Check the stocking updates and lake maps on our webpage. Best success is early in the morning, or at dusk. Bait, spinners, and small flies are effective.\n\nEvery year we have numerous reports about anglers taking more than their legal limit of fish from area stocked lakes. These fish are easy to catch and provide local anglers, unable to venture into the field, with good fishing opportunity. Be aware of bag/possession limits, and do not harvest more than allowed to let more anglers share this bounty.\n\nMay is an excellent time to fish for the Anchorage area's illegally-introduced northern pike, as they become voracious feeders after spawning. Your best bet is Lower Fire Lake as all other Anchorage area lakes have been eracdicated of pike.\n\nThis illegally introduced species is threatening our stocked lakes program and some wild salmon stocks. Please keep any pike you catch, but remember that \"wanton waste\" laws apply. There is no daily bag limit for pike and spears as well as bow and arrow are legal gear. The arrow must be barbed and attached to the bow. A free pamphlet with maps and Anchorage area lake information, along with pike cleaning and cooking tips is available at Department of Fish and Game offices or on the Department Internet pages.\n\nAnyone with any information on these illegal-stocking activities is encouraged to contact Fish and Wildlife Safeguard at 1-800-478-3377 or State Troopers’ Fish and Wildlife Protection at (907) 269-5954 or 269-5541."

    "full_text": "Mid-June sees the peak for fishing for hatchery-stocked king salmon in Ship Creek. Most fish are taken either during slack high tide or 1-2 hours before and after high tide. While most Ship Creek kings average 20-25 lbs., there are a few 50+ pounders available. Once the peak of the run has past, fishing continues to be fair through the season closure in July. Some of the more popular tackle includes large VibraxTM spinners, Spin-n-GlosTM, PixeesTM, yarn flies – some with fluorescent corkies, and fresh salmon roe.\n\nThe Ship Creek King Salmon Derby, which benefits the Downtown Soup Kitchen, takes place in early June. Check the local tackle shops or newspapers for more information.\n\nAlthough angler success fishing for king salmon in Eagle River is often poor, it does represent a slim opportunity. Eagle River king fishing is weekend only (Saturday, Sunday and Monday) for three weekends in June. Check the regulation booklet for dates.\n\nBait is legal in both of these king salmon sport fisheries. Once you have harvested a king salmon, you must immediately record that harvest on the back of your fishing license, or on an ADF&G Annual Harvest Record Card (see the regulations). Also, once you harvest a king salmon from the Anchorage Management Area, you may not fish for any species of fish in waters open to king salmon fishing for the remainder of the day.\n\nKing and red (sockeye) salmon begin their annual migration up Campbell Creek in early-June. Anglers are reminded that except for a kids-only fishery, the entire Campbell Creek drainage is closed to king and red salmon sport fishing, including catch-and-release. Poaching is a big problem at Campbell Creek. Enforcement personnel from Fish and Wildlife Protection and Anchorage Police Department officers have beefed up their patrols along Campbell Creek as a result.\n\nAll other waters in the Anchorage area are closed to king salmon sport fishing year-round, including Bird Creek.\n\nIf you see any illegal fishing please call the Alaska State Troopers’ Fish and Wildlife Protection office (269-5954 or 269-5541), or the Fish and Wildlife Safeguard “Report Poachers” hotline (1-800-478-3377) or the Alaska Department of Fish and Game Southcentral Region Information Center (267-2218).\n\nThere’s a kids-only king salmon fishery on Campbell Creek in the last weekend of June. Only youth 15 or younger may fish in a special section of the creek, on Saturday and Sunday. Daily limit and harvest recording requirements apply. This is a great opportunity to teach kids how to fish for salmon, and there are often educational events as well.\n\nRainbow trout and Dolly Varden fishing should be fair to good in Campbell Creek upstream of Dowling and fair in Chester Creek near Behm/APU Lake. Some rainbow anglers like to fish Ship Creek from Reeve Boulevard to Department markers upstream of the Chugach dam, but remember, this reach is no bait, single-hook, artificial lures only, and rainbow trout cannot be kept.\n\nUpstream of the forks at Piper Street, Campbell Creek turns to unbaited, single-hook, artificial lures only, and rainbow trout cannot be kept in these waters.\n\nRainbows and Dollies often become less active as the sun climbs the sky. Best success is usually early in the morning, or later in the evening. Fish the deep pools, or the deeper channels.\n\nJune is an excellent month to try one of Anchorage’s stocked lakes. Rainbow trout from 8\" to 12\" provide good to excellent fishing in the early morning hours! Some lakes receive Arctic grayling, and some Arctic char. Small spinners and flies are effective (size 10 or 12), while the best baits include raw shrimp, salmon eggs, and worms. The lakes are a great opportunity to introduce a youngster (or oldster!) to fishing.\n\nA free brochure with maps and area lake information is available at Department of Fish and Game offices. Also visit our stocked lakes maps and the fish stocking updates web pages.\n\nIllegally-introduced northern pike are present in Lower Fire Lake. Pike have been eradicated from all other Anchorage area lakes that had confirmed reports of illegal introduction. There is no daily bag limit for pike and spears and bow and arrow are legal. Hunt for pike in shallow, weedy areas. As the water warms up, the pike become more lethargic, so pike anglers have better luck early in the morning and later in the evenings. Bait and multiple hooks are legal, and be sure to keep all the pike you catch. If it’s more than you can eat, check with your favorite charity to see if they would like to accept some fresh fish. Remember: it’s illegal to waste sport-caught fish.\n\nEven though the Turnagain Arm hooligan run winds down by the end of the first week of June, fish should be available through the season closure of June 15 in the Twentymile River. Dippers are reminded that dipnetting in saltwater along Turnagain Arm closed May 31.\n\nOnly Alaska residents with a sport fishing license in possession can use a dipnet for hooligan. Dipping on the rising or flood tide usually produces the best results, and while a tide of at least 25 feet as measured at Anchorage is recommended, fish are available at any tide stage. Gillnets may not be used in Turnagain Arm. Use common sense while pursuing hooligan and do not venture out onto the mud flats."

A reminder: once you have harvested a king salmon, you must immediately record that harvest on the back of your fishing license, or on an ADF&G Annual Harvest Record Card (see the regulations). Also, once you harvest a king salmon, you may not fish for any species of fish in waters open to king salmon fishing for the remainder of the day.\n\nBy mid-July silver salmon start to return to Anchorage’s Ship Creek and Campbell Creek, as well as Bird Creek, which is about 27 miles south of downtown Anchorage on the Seward Highway. Most silvers caught in Ship and Bird creeks are taken about two hours before high tide, or 1 hour after high tide. In Campbell Creek, most silver success is early in the morning, before the sun shines onto the creek. Ship Creek and Bird Creek silver salmon fisheries peak in late July to early August, while Campbell Creek peaks around mid- to late August. All are hatchery release-driven fisheries.\n\nCampbell Creek opens to silver salmon fishing from Dimond Boulevard upstream to Shelikof Street on July 14. Campbell Creek has two sections closed to all fishing year-round. They are those sections of Campbell Creek/Campbell Lake downstream of Dimond Blvd. to Cook Inlet, and Campbell Creek between Shelikof Street and Lake Otis Parkway. Open seasons and legal tackle vary according to which section of this stream you are fishing. Be sure to check out the map in the regulation booklet and know where you are when you fish.\n\nOn even-numbered years, good numbers of pink salmon also enter Ship and Bird creeks. Pinks are an excellent way to introduce youngsters (and other novice salmon anglers) to fishing.\n\nStreams at the head of Turnagain Arm — such as the Placer River and the Twentymile River — also start to see adult salmon returning to spawn. Starting in mid- to late July both of these streams have wild runs of pink and chum salmon starting to show, along with a few silvers.\n\nThe bag and possession limit for salmon (other than king salmon 20” or longer) in all Turnagain streams, with the exception of hatchery enhanced streams (Bird, Ship and Campbell creeks), is 3 salmon of which only 2 can be silver salmon. In Bird, Ship, and Campbell creeks, daily limits for salmon (other than king salmon 20\" or longer) are 3 per day/3 in possession, and all 3 can be coho (silver) salmon. All Turnagian Arm stream are closed to fishing for king salmon, including catch and release.\n\nSome of the more popular silver and pink tackle includes medium VibraxTM spinners, Spin-n-GlosTM, PixeesTM, yarn flies – some with fluorescent corkies, and fresh salmon roe. Bait is legal in the Ship, Bird, and Campbell creek salmon sport fisheries. Salmon eggs under a bobber at high slack tide on Ship Creek is a very effective method for silvers.\n\nKing and red (sockeye) salmon are still migrating up Campbell Creek in July. Anglers are reminded that the entire Campbell Creek drainage is closed to king and red salmon sport fishing, including catch-and-release. Poaching is a big problem at Campbell Creek. Enforcement personnel from Fish and Wildlife Protection and Anchorage Police Department officers have beefed up their patrols along Campbell Creek as a result. If you see any illegal fishing please call either the Alaska State Troopers’ Fish and Wildlife Protection office (269-5954 or 269-5541) Fish and Wildlife Safeguard’s “Report Poachers” hotline (1-800-478-3377) or the Alaska Department of Fish and Game Southcentral Region Information Center (267-2218).\n\nRainbow trout and Dolly Varden fishing should be fair to good in Campbell Creek upstream of Dowling and fair in Chester Creek near University/APU Lake. Rainbow anglers also like to fish Ship Creek from Reeve Boulevard to Department markers upstream of the Chugach dam, but remember this reach is no bait, single-hook, artificial lures only and rainbow trout cannot be kept.\n\nUpstream of the forks at Piper Street, Campbell Creek turns to unbaited, single-hook, artificial lures only, and rainbow trout cannot be kept in these waters. Dolly fishing should be great in upper Campbell and the North Fork Campbell Creek in late July as they follow the spawning kings looking for an easy meal.\n\nRainbows and Dollies often become less active as the sun climbs the sky.

There is no daily bag limit for pike and spears and bow fishing are legal. Hunt for pike in shallow, weedy areas. The highest pike concentration in Lower Fire Lake appears to be along the shore near where Fire Creek empties into this lake near the Old Glenn Highway. As the water warms up, the pike become more lethargic, so pike anglers have better luck early in the morning and later in the evenings. Bait and multiple hooks are legal, and be sure to keep all the pike you catch. If it’s more than you can eat, check with your favorite charity to see if they would like to accept some fresh fish.

    "full_text": "Many Anchorage area silver salmon runs are in full swing in August. First to appear are the hatchery-enhanced fish at Ship and Bird creeks, followed by the hatchery-enhanced run at Campbell Creek. Area native runs are also well underway during August, and often run into September.\n\nOn even-numbered years, a fair number of pink salmon are also available in the area streams open to salmon fishing.\n\nMost people fish Ship and Bird creek 1-2 hours before and after high tide, but when the runs are at peak (early-mid August) fish can be available at all tidal stages. VibraxTM and PixeesTM are perennial Alaskan favorites as are “yarn flies,” though silvers and pinks will often bite at almost any shiny lure. Bait, such as preserved salmon eggs or cut herring is also popular (and allowed) in the Ship and Bird creek salmon fishery. The Ship Creek silver salmon Derby usually takes place during the first two weeks of August.\n\nThe Campbell Creek salmon fishery has special opening schedules, and silver salmon are the ONLY salmon you are allowed to fish for on that creek.\n\nOn July 14, Campbell Creek is open to silver salmon sport fishing from markers under the Dimond Boulevard bridge upstream to the markers at Shelikof Street and then from the Lake Otis Parkway bridge upstream to the forks near Piper Street. Campbell Creek is closed to all sport fishing between Shelikof Street and the Lake Otis Parkway bridge (Wickersham subdivision), and downstream of Dimond Boulevard (including Campbell Lake).\n\nLow, clear water conditions and warm, sunny days often spook the Campbell Creek silvers. Best silver fishing usually happens after rainy weather, when water temperatures drop, and water levels rise. Look for deep holes, and drift your lure or bait through the hole. Most fishing effort takes place downstream of Dowling Blvd. to the Dimond Blvd. bridge.\n\nThe more popular streams with natural runs are the Twentymile, Portage, and Placer river drainages. These runs usually peak in late August or early September. Anglers usually use shiny lures, and bait is also sometimes used. Remember that the upper reaches of Twentymile, Glacier, and Carmen rivers, an un-named slough on lower Portage Creek, as well as portions of Lower Explorer and Skookum creeks closed to sport fishing July 14. Placer Creek in Bear Valley (near the Whittier tunnel) is closed year-round to salmon fishing, but open year-round to for all other species. Consult the Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing regulation booklet before heading out to fish these areas and know where you are fishing.\n\nIn the Anchorage area, the bag limit for salmon 16\" or longer (other than kings) is three per day and in possession. On Ship, Bird, and Campbell creeks, all three salmon may be silvers. On all other streams open to silver salmon fishing, which include portions of Eklutna River, Eagle River, Glacier Creek, California Creek, Twentymile River, Portage Creek, and the Placer River drainages, only 2 of your 3 may be silvers. King salmon sport fishing is closed.\n\nWhen weather and water conditions are perfect — not too muddy from recent rains, and not too hot — rainbow trout and Dolly Varden fishing on Campbell Creek can be excellent. Remember that upstream of the forks near Piper Street, it's catch-and-release only for rainbows, and you can use only single-hook, unbaited, artificial lures.\n\nThe Anchorage area stocked lakes are consistent producers of fun fishing! As the weather cools, lake fishing usually gets better and better, offering an alternative to shoulder-to-shoulder salmon angling. Check our website for maps to the lakes and stocking information. Three Anchorage area lakes, Jewel, Delong and Mirror lakes, are usually stocked with rainbow trout three times each year, with the last stocking in late August. Best baits are usually single salmon eggs or fresh shrimp. Small spinners and flies are also very effective. Fly-fishing during the fall from a belly boat is an excellent way to catch these late-stocked fish.\n\nNorthern pike were illegally introduced into Sand Lake, Lower Fire Lake, Cheney Lake, and Otter Lake. They have been eradicated in all but Lower Fire Lake. There is no limit on pike in the Anchorage area and spears are legal. Anglers pursuing pike with rod and reel are encouraged to target pike, but remember, snagging and wasting speared or rod and reel caught pike is illegal. Effective lures include top-water \"poppers\" and \"buzz baits.\"\n\nFolks that are dumping pike into local lakes are a real threat to your recreational fisheries. Anyone with any information on these illegal-stocking activities is encouraged to contact Fish and Wildlife Safeguard at 1-800-478-3377 or State Troopers’ Fish and Wildlife Protection at (907) 269-5954 or 269-5541."

Best success is from boats, so if you plan on chasing ducks in the area, don’t put away your silver gear just yet.\n\nShore-based anglers should try Ship and Bird creeks, which will have small numbers of silvers trickling in until late September. At Ship Creek the best time to catch September silvers appears to be at the start of the outgoing tide. In Bird Creek, sight fishing with eggs or large spinners produces the best catches.\n\nRemember that the upper reaches of Twentymile, Glacier, and Carmen rivers, an un-named slough on lower Portage Creek, as well as portions of Lower Explorer and Skookum creeks closed to sport fishing July 14. This seasonal closure protects spawning silver salmon. Placer Creek in Bear Valley (near the Whittier tunnel) is closed year-round to salmon fishing, but open year-round to for all other species. Consult the regulation booklet before heading out to fish these areas and know where you are when you’re fishing.\n\nDepending on the weather, the Campbell Creek silver salmon fishery is a fair try for September. Low, clear water conditions and warm, sunny days often spook the Campbell Creek silvers. Best silver fishing usually happens after rainy weather, when water temperatures drop, and water levels rise. Look for deep holes, and drift your lure or bait through the hole. Most fishing effort takes place downstream of Dowling Blvd. to the Dimond Blvd. bridge.

As the weather cools, lake fishing usually gets better and better, offering an alternative to shoulder-to-shoulder salmon angling. Fall fishing in local stocked lakes can be pretty lonely as effort generally tapers off this time of the year. Fly-fishing from a float tube in local stocked lakes will produce some nice rainbows. Several local lakes are also stocked with Arctic char. To discover what is stocked in local lakes, check our website page containing directions to stocked lakes, bathymetric maps of stocked lakes and the stocking history of each lake. Best baits are usually single salmon eggs or fresh shrimp. Small spinners and flies are also very effective.\n\nNorthern pike were illegally introduced into Sand, Cheney, Campbell, Otter, and Lower Fire lakes but have been eradicated from all but Lower Fire Lake . There is no limit on pike in the Anchorage area. Along with rod and reel, bow and arrow and spears are legal. If you hunt pike with a bow, the arrow must be attached to the bow. Anglers pursuing pike with rod and reel are encouraged to target pike, but remember, both snagging and wasting pike is illegal. Effective lures include top-water \"poppers\" and \"buzz baits.\" Your best bet for pike in the Anchorage area now is Lower Fire lakes.

Closures are necessary in order to protect spawning fish. Anglers will likely have a hard time catching large halibut because most spawning fish are far offshore along the continental shelf, in 400-600 feet of water.\n\nAnglers must keep the first two demersal (non-pelagic) rockfish they catch. Non-pelagic rockfish - such as yelloweye, quillback, or copper rockfish - need this additional protection because they have difficulty resubmerging unassisted after they are brought to the surface and experience a change in pressure. Rockfish are extremely long-lived fish, and are slow to reach sexual maturity. Overharvest would quickly reduce the number of mature fish available to spawn. Methods to release rockfish with deepwater release mechanisms have been researched and anglers are encouraged to use these devices. For more information,see the Rockfish Conservation pages.\n\n\"Winter\" kings may be caught throughout the Sound, and in many near-shore salt waters of Alaska. Also called \"feeder\" kings, they are cruising the Sound, fattening up before returning to their home stream to spawn. Try using downriggers fishing 60 feet or deeper.\n\nArea fresh waters should prove fair for Dolly Varden fishing. Try fishing the mouths of freshwater streams, where they empty into the Sound. Good bets are imitations of the salmon lifecycle - eggs, flesh flies - or small silvery spinners or spoons.\n\nFishing for cutthroat trout should be poor to fair throughout the Sound in the winter months. The bag limit for trout in all waters is 2 trout per day, 2 in possession of which only one per day and in possession may greater than 20 inches in length. All trout over 20 inches retained must be recorded on the harvest recording form of your license and only 2 fish over 20 inches per year may be retained.\n\nSome nice stocked rainbow trout in the 6-8\" range are caught from Blueberry Lake, Thompson Lake, and Ruth Pond in Valdez. Grayling were historically stocked in Thompson Lake near Valdez and some are still found in lake. Both these aggressive feeders will go after small spinners or flies. Try an egg-sucking leech, Royal Coachman, or bead-headed Prince nymph.\n\nThe shrimp season does not open until April 15. Subsistence Tanner and king crab fisheries are now allowed in winter months. SeePrince William Sound subsistence regulation booksfor these fishery regulations."

The bag limit for trout in all waters is 2 trout per day, 2 in possession of which only one per day and in possession may greater than 20 inches in length. All trout over 20 inches retained must be recorded immediately and only 2 fish over 20 inches per year may be retained.\n\nSome nice stocked rainbow trout in the 6-8\" range are caught from Blueberry Lake, Thompson Lake, and Ruth Pond in Valdez. Grayling were historically stocked in Thompson Lake near Valdez and some are still found in the lake. Both of these aggressive feeders will go after small spinners or flies. Try an egg-sucking leech, Royal Coachman, or bead-headed Prince nymph.\n\nThe shrimp season opens April 15. Shrimp fishing is open until September 15th. Shrimp are primarily found in deep waters and often in inlets that have glacial inputs. Shrimp will begin to move into deeper waters as the fall season progresses."

    "full_text": "By mid- to late May, hatchery-stocked king salmon start to show up in Fleming Spit (Cordova area). Look for these king runs to build through the month of May, and peak in mid-June. Anglers looking for fresh king salmon also often have success trolling for \"feeder\" kings. Red salmon also begin to make their appearance by mid-May in locations such as the Eyak River (Cordova) and Main Bay (western Sound).\n\nWhen the weather cooperates, early to mid-May can see some nice halibut catches in the 20- 30-pound range throughout the Sound. Larger fish are usually found nearer the end of May. Weather permitting; larger boats often target halibut in ocean entrances of the Sound near Hinchinbrook Entrance and Montague Straits. Nearer to home ports: Passage Canal, Wells Passage, Knowles Head are popular places to jig. Remember, it is illegal to fish for, or harvest, lingcod until July 1. All lingcod incidentally caught must be landed only by hand or with a landing net and released immediately. Fishing for rockfish is also good in May. From May 1-Sept. 15, the limits are 4 rockfish per day/ 8 in possession, of which no more than 2 per day/ 2 in possession may be non-pelagic rockfish. Anglers must retain the first two non-pelagic rockfish they catch and ADF&G recommends the use of a deepwater release mechanism to release rockfish an angler is unable to keep rather than releasing them at the surface. For more information on deepwater release,see the Rockfish Conservation pages.\n\nOpportunities in May for Dolly Varden should be good throughout Prince William lakes and streams, especially at ice-out. Try a dry fly at the water's edge, or casting a lure with some silver flash to imitate salmon fry and smolt. Sport Fish Division stocks rainbow trout catchables in Blueberry Lake, Thompson Lake, and Ruth Pond near Valdez. Grayling were also historically stocked in Thompson Lake and can still be found in the lake. Fishing for cutthroat trout is closed from April 15- June 14 to protect spawning fish.\n\nFishing for shrimp opens on April 15, and catches are highly variable depending on location fished.

    "full_text": "Halibut fishing generally improves in mid-June, and when the weather cooperates, good fishing can be found in the waters around Hinchinbrook Entrance, Montague Strait, and outside of Montague Island. However, small boat anglers can obtain decent catches closer to port. Out of Whittier, good catches can be made in Port Wells and out to Lone Island. Valdez anglers in small boats typically fish the northeast part of the sound, including Jack Bay, Galena Bay, Port Fidalgo, Knowles Head, and Bligh Reef. Orca Bay and the north side of Hinchinbrook Island provide good fishing for Cordova anglers.\n\nThe city of Valdez sponsors a halibut derby. Check with the city's Chamber of Commerce for details.\n\nBy early June, hatchery stocked king salmon should be showing up in Cordova and Valdez. By mid-June, catches at Fleming Spit in Cordova are very good on the rising tides. Also by mid-June, hatchery returns should be good in Valdez. These runs are over by the end of June. Successful anglers cast hardware or drift salmon eggs with a bobber a couple of hours before the peak high tide. Sockeye begin moving up the Copper River in early June, but haven't spread into the systems off the Copper River Highway by then. Look for these fish to enter the streams by mid-June. The fly-fishing area at the mouth of Eyak Lake is good spot to try. Mid-June on the western side of the Sound sees sockeye returning in good numbers to Main Bay and the Coghill system.\n\nChum salmon fishing near Lake Bay on the southern end of Esther Island, and in Passage Canal and Wells Passage is very good in early to mid-June.\n\nPink salmon return by mid-June, and excellent fishing is usually reported from Valdez by then.\n\nLingcod fishing remains closed until July 1. All lingcod incidentally caught must be landed only by hand or with a landing net and released immediately.\n\nRockfish fishing remains good in June. From May 1-Sept. 15, the limit is 4 rockfish per day/ 8 in possession, of which no more than 2 per day/ 2 in possession may be non-pelagic species. Anglers must retain the first two non-pelagic rockfish they catch. Additional protection is needed for non-pelagic species because of their extreme longevity and low productivity. The use of adeepwater release mechanismis highly recommended to release rockfish that can’t be kept. Halibut anglers are strongly encouraged to fish with a single large hook (size 16 or larger) and avoid rocky areas to minimize their unintentional rockfish catch. Anglers targeting rockfish are encouraged to fish for black or dusky rockfish in waters less than 10 fathoms (60 feet) to minimize mortality of released fish.\n\nThe daily bag limit for sharks is one fish of any species, and the annual limit is two sharks of any species. The exception is spiny dogfish. The daily bag/possession limit for spiny dogfish is 5 fish and there is no annual limit. Sleeper sharks are generally considered inedible and should be released. All sharks have high urea content, and are inedible unless handled properly. Bleed your shark immediately upon capture by cutting the underside of the tail, and let the bleeding continue until the heart stops. Gutting the fish with a single cut from the anus to the gills can enhance the quality of the meat. Please do not cut off the head or tail until after the fish is landed to ensure that ADF&G port samplers have an opportunity to obtain measurements.\n\nThe Division of Sport Fish collects data from the recreational bottomfish fishery in the Whittier and Valdez boat harbors. Fishery technicians interview returning anglers and sample halibut, rockfish, and sharks for length, weight, sex, and age statistics. You can help by providing information when interviewed and by returning fish carcasses to the harbor for sampling by the technicians. Information collected by this project is used to monitor the health of the fishery, advise halibut management agencies, and help the Board of Fisheries formulate regulations that protect fish stock and provide maximum fishing opportunity. Contact Barbi Failor in Homer (235-1731) for additional information.\n\nBy mid-June, the herring show up at the Valdez City Dock, and anglers can be found jigging small strands of multiple hooks.\n\nIn June, opportunities for Dolly Varden are good to fair throughout Prince William. Dolly fishing should become excellent as Dollies follow the salmon into the lakes and streams. Try targeting Dollies by presenting them with a dry fly at the water's edge, or casting a lure with some silver flash to imitate salmon fry and smolt.\n\nThe Sport Fish Division stocks rainbow trout in Blueberry Lake, Thompson Lake, and Ruth Pond near Valdez. Grayling were also historically stocked in Thompson Lake.\n\nOnly artificial, unbaited lures may be used in fresh waters until June 15. Also, fishing for cutthroat trout is closed from April 15- June 14 to protect spawning trout. Once fishing opens June 15, fishing should be good throughout the Sound. The bag limit for trout in all waters is 2 trout per day, 2 in possession of which only one per day and in possession may be greater than 20 inches in length, all trout over 20 inches retained must be recorded immediately and only 2 fish over 20 inches per year may be retained.\n\nShrimp fishing is open until September 15th.

    "full_text": "Halibut fishing generally continues to be good in July. When the weather cooperates, anglers can venture out to Hinchinbrook Entrance, Montague Strait, and the far side of Montague Island for the best halibut fishing. Small boat anglers can obtain decent catches closer to port, but with success rates are often lower. Out of Whittier, good catches can be made in Port Wells and out to Lone Island. Valdez anglers in small boats typically fish the northeast part of the Sound, including Jack Bay, Galena Bay, Port Fidalgo, Knowles Head, and Bligh Reef. Orca Bay and the north side of Hinchinbrook Island provide good fishing for Cordova anglers.\n\n\"Feeder\" king salmon can be caught around Cordova and Whittier using downriggers fishing 60 feet or deeper. The hatchery runs to Whittier and Cordova tail off by the first week of July.\n\nAlso in July, red salmon (sockeye) move up the Copper and Bering Rivers in strong numbers, and start to spread into the tributaries off the Copper River Highway. The fly-fishing only area at the mouth of Eyak Lake is good spot to try in early to mid-July. Anglers also have success fishing from boats in Eyak River. Good sockeye catches are also reported from the western part of the Sound, and from Whittier. Anglers target the Coghill system, as well as Main Bay.\n\nChum salmon show a strong return to Lake Bay Hatchery on the southern end of Ester Island in early July, and a few show up in systems like Hartney Bay out of Cordova. Chum runs are pretty much done by mid-July.\n\nPink salmon begin their return in early to mid-July, with the run peaking by mid- to late July on the eastern side of the Sound, and early to mid-August on the western side. Pinks caught in saltwater are bright and feisty, not the tired \"humpies\" of freshwater fame. Good places near Valdez to try are Jack Bay and Allison Point. In the eastern part of the Sound, strong pink returns come into Sheep and Simpson bays near Cordova. Out of Whittier, anglers catch pinks in Wells Passage, Port Wells, and the entrance to Eaglek Bay. Try offering them a pink or orange Pixie.\n\nThe much-anticipated silver salmon run begins by the beginning of the second week of July. This early, most of the bright, fat silvers are still out near Bligh Island, but they move in closer to shore as July progresses. In mid-July, in the Valdez area, anglers catch silvers in Jack Bay, Blackstone Point, Sawmill Bay, down through Bligh Reef, and, once the run gets going, right outside the city dock. In the western Sound, silver anglers try their luck around the Coghill system. Out of Whittier, anglers will mooch and troll for silvers around Ester Island and down to Eshamy.\n\nThere are some salmon \"terminal harvest areas\" in Prince William Sound, where bag limits are more liberal. Check the regulation booklet for a description of these areas.\n\nLingcod fishing opens July 1, but special restrictions remain in effect. The limit in Prince William Sound waters east of Cape Puget is two fish daily (four in possession). All lingcod must be at least 35 inches in total length, or 28 inches with the head removed. Gaffs can not be used on fish that are released.\n\nRockfish fishing remains good in July. From May 1-Sept. 15, the limit is 4 rockfish per day/ 8 in possession, of which no more than 2 per day/ 2 in possession may be non-pelagic species.

    "full_text": "August still sees plenty of pink salmon action throughout Prince William Sound. Jumpers can be seen nearly everywhere and good catches come in from Sheep and Simpson bays out of Cordova. Allison Point in Valdez is a popular place for shore anglers in early to mid-August. Later in the month, a few large bright fish can still be caught trolling from Valdez out to the Narrows. Out of Whittier, August anglers catch pinks in Wells Passage, Port Wells, and the entrance to Eaglek Bay.\n\nPinks will wind down around the third week of August, just about time for the silver salmon fishing to heat up. Valdez has hatchery-enhanced runs returning in mid-August. Valdez anglers anxious for early bright, feisty silvers should try Anderson Bay, Shoup Bay, and Gold or Mineral creeks. Silver salmon anglers can also try the mouths of Galena and Jack bays, Pt. Freemantle, Busby Island, and the Anderson waterfall. Allison Point in late August is a good place to be for excellent silver action. The City of Valdez sponsors a silver salmon derby in late July through Sept. Call the Valdez Convention & Visitor's Bureau for more information at (907) 835-4636, or check their website at www.valdezalaska.org.\n\nOn the western side of the Sound, look for silvers in Port Wells, near Esther Island, the Dutch Group islands, and Perry Island. Whittier anglers target Wells Passage, Pigot Bay, Culross Passage, and Decision Point. Shore-based anglers must wait until the last week of August for silvers to arrive in the Whittier harbor.\n\nIn Cordova, look for silvers around mid-August at the mouth of the Eyak River, and in Orca Inlet, with the run peaking in early September. Silvers that have been stocked return to Fleming Spit around mid-August and peak in early September.\n\nGeneral salmon bag limits for pink and chum salmon are 6 per day/ 12 in possession. Other species and some areas have area-specific limits so look at the regulation book before fishing for salmon.\n\nIn almost all marine and fresh waters of Prince William Sound only 3 per day and 3 in possession may be silver salmon. However, the following 5 areas have \"special\" silver salmon regulations, and some we define as \"Terminal Harvest\" areas. Both these special areas have the following bag/possession limits for salmon 16\" or longer (other than kings):\n\nFor specific descriptions of these areas, check the Southcentral sport fishing regulation booklet. \"I didn't know\" is not considered a legal excuse.\n\nSockeye (red) salmon also provide some saltwater opportunity in Prince William Sound in early and mid-August, but taper off quickly by the end of August. Good places to target sockeye are on the western side of the Sound in Eshamy and Main bays. The Coghill system, in Port Wells, may also produce fair sockeye fishing in early August.\n\nA few feeder king salmon can be picked up around Valdez, Cordova, and Whittier. Try using downriggers fishing 60 feet or deeper. You may keep only 2 king salmon per day and have only 2 in possession as part of your total salmon bag limits.\n\nChum salmon are also available in streams throughout the Sound, around Esther Island, and systems like Hartney Bay out of Cordova usually produce some nice catches.\n\nNice weather and hard fishing during the early part of August can bring in some good halibut catches. Montague Island, Wessels Reef out in the Gulf, Seal Rocks, Channel Island off Green Island, and the Hinchinbrook Lighthouse area often bring in good-sized fish. A bit closer to Valdez, anglers land nice-sized halibut from Jack and Sawmill bays, Bligh Reef, and Middle Rock. On the western side of the Sound, try fishing in Port Wells; off Coghill Point; in Eaglek, Long, or Pigot bays; and around the Dutch Group islands. Lingcod fishing remains open with special restrictions in effect. The limit in Prince William Sound waters east of Cape Fairfield is two fish daily (four in possession). All lingcod must be at least 35 inches in length, and fish that are released cannot be gaffed.\n\nRockfish fishing should remain good. Until Sept. 15 the limit is 4 rockfish per day (8 in possession) of which no more than 2 per day (2 in possession) may be non-pelagic species. Anglers must retain the first two non-pelagic rockfish they catch. Additional protection is needed for non-pelagic species because of their extreme longevity and low productivity. Anglers are encouraged to use deepwater release mechansims to release rockfish once their limit has been reached. For more information,see the Rockfish Conservation pages. Halibut anglers are strongly encouraged to fish with a single large hook (size 16 or larger) and avoid rocky areas to minimize their unintentional rockfish catch. Anglers targeting rockfish are encouraged to fish for black or dusky rockfish in waters less than 10 fathoms (60 feet) to minimize mortality of released fish.\n\nThe daily bag limit for sharks is one fish of any species, and the annual limit is two sharks of any species.

    "full_text": "Halibut fishing typically slows down in September. Many of the adult fish have started their offshore migration, and many anglers turn their attentions to silver salmon during this time, but those who persist may have success. Anglers can expect to catch mostly small halibut inside the Sound, with better fishing in outside waters.\n\nSilver salmon usually provide plenty of shore-based action through the third week of September. There are large hatchery returns to Valdez shorelines (Allison Point and the Valdez city dock), to Esther Island, to Fleming Spit in Cordova, and to Whittier/Passage Canal. Boat anglers head toward Mineral or Gold creeks in Valdez Arm.\n\nThere are small wild runs of silvers throughout the Sound. Anglers typically target Port Wells, the Dutch Group islands, and Perry Island. Whittier anglers target Wells Passage, Pigot Bay, Culross Passage, and Decision Point. Cordova anglers head toward the Eyak River and Ibeck Creek.\n\nAlthough snagging is a legal method in the majority of Prince William Sound salt waters, most silver anglers will be casting medium to heavy spoons or spinners, such as Pixees ™, Vibrax ™, and Tee-Spoons ™. Anglers also like to add a gob of fresh or preserved salmon roe, or a chunk of herring as an extra enticement. Portions of Orca Inlet, and portions of Eshamy Lagoon are closed to snagging: check the regulation booklet closely.\n\nExcept in 5 areas, salmon bag limits are 6 per day and 12 in possession, of which only 3 per day/3 in possession can be silvers in all marine and fresh waters of Prince William Sound. The 5 areas with different regulations are:\n\nBefore you throw a line in the water, check the Southcentral regulations for an exact description of these waters and which areas are open to the larger bag limits.\n\nSockeye (red), pink, and chum salmon runs are pretty much over by early September.

Gaffs cannot be used to land fish that are released.\n\nRockfish fishing remains good in September, when boats can brave the weather and leave port. Until Sept. 15, the limit is 4 rockfish per day/ 8 in possession, of which no more than 2 per day/ 2 in possession may be non-pelagic species. After Sept. 15, the daily limit is 8 per day/8 in possession, of which no more than 2 per day/2 in possession may be non-pelagic species.\n\nAnglers must keep the first two non-pelagic rockfish they catch. Additional protection is needed for non-pelagic species because of their extreme longevity, low productivity, and their general inability to successfully submerge to depth. Anglers are encouraged to usedeepwater release mechanismsto release rockfish once their limit has been reached. Halibut anglers are strongly encouraged to fish with a single large hook (size 16 or larger) and avoid rocky areas to minimize their unintentional rockfish catch. Anglers targeting rockfish are encouraged to fish for black or dusky rockfish in waters less than 10 fathoms (60 feet) to minimize mortality of released fish.\n\nSome sharks, particularly spiny dogfish, are likely to be caught throughout September. The daily bag limit for sharks is one fish of any species, and the annual limit is two sharks of any species. The exception is spiny dogfish. The daily bag/possession limit for spiny dogfish is 5 fish and there is no annual limit. Sleeper sharks are generally considered inedible and should be released. All harvested sharks must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record. All sharks have high urea content, and are inedible unless handled properly. Bleed your shark immediately upon capture by cutting the underside of the tail, and let the bleeding continue until the heart stops. Then gut the fish with a single cut from the anus to the gills and remove all entrails to enhance the quality of the meat.\n\nThe Division of Sport Fish collects data from the recreational bottomfish fishery in the Whittier and Valdez boat harbors only through the first week of September. Information collected through catch sampling will be summarized in reports for the Alaska Board of Fisheries, the International Pacific Halibut Commission, and the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. Contact Barbi Failor in Homer (235-1731) for additional information.\n\nFishing for cutthroat trout should be good throughout the Sound. The bag limit for the Sound is 2 per day and 2 in possession. The bag limit for trout in all waters is 2 trout per day, 2 in possession of which only one per day and in possession may greater than 20 inches in length. All trout over 20 inches retained must be recorded immediately and only 2 fish over 20 inches per year may be retained.\n\nSeptember opportunities for Dolly Varden are good throughout Prince William, with hungry Dollies following spawning salmon.

Non-pelagic (demersal) rockfish - such as yelloweye, quillback, and coppers - need this additional protection because they have difficulty resubmerging unassisted after they are brought to the surface and experience a change in pressure.

Fishing for rainbows, Dollies, grayling can be fair to very good where open water can be found, or through the ice. Typical ice fishing techniques for trout, Dolly , smelt and pike include jigging and tip-ups. In the darkest and coldest days, success can be minimal, but if a warm spell comes, or in late February as the days grow longer, angler success can be good. For the bigger species, salmon eggs, herring, or big colorful spoons in shades of bright green, red-and-white, or silver are popular. Standby lures include Daredevles®, Krocodiles®, Pixees®, Swedish Pimples® and similar - check with local tackle shops for their recommendations. It is also legal to spear northern pike through the ice. For smelt, use very small lures for jigging. Check regulations carefully for single-hook and fly-fishing-only waters.\n\nThe ice can be very thick - 4 feet or more in places and a power auger is a real blessing. But hand crank augers and hand chisels can be a great way to get some winter aerobic exercise - just don't overheat and risk getting chilled.\n\nIce thickness can vary with the weather, especially on the rivers, so always be very careful. Only a few degrees change in the weather can mean several inches difference in ice thickness, especially on the bigger rivers, and especially as the end of winter approaches. What was safe at zero F. or -10° F. may not be safe at +15° F.\n\nIf you are smelting - which is often done on tidal ice - know the tide schedules and be familiar with your fishing spot.\n\nIn some winters, or during warm spells, anglers may find open waters in the Bristol Bay area. If it's possible to access these waters safely they may offer some traditional rod and reel angling opportunity. Spoons, spinners, plugs and bait (where legal) are used. Some of the eastern Bristol Bay rivers are the most common opportunities, especially in late February. As usual, be sure to check the regulations before you head out to fish."

The information in the Commercial Services Provider list is given to us in response to a department questionnaire. The list usually finalized for the season in April /May.\n\nMost lakes stay ice-covered until mid- to late May, and some of the higher lakes don't thaw until mid- or late June. By late April, river ice is usually melting, at least near inlet and outlets, but may start melting as early as mid-March in a warm year. Warm spells and underwater springs may contribute to \"overflow\" - areas of water or slush on top of ice. Look for discolored ice, and walk and drive where others have gone.\n\nDon't forget good sunglasses and even sun screen for those special bright days. A day on the ice and snow in brilliant sun can cause painful snow blindness and even sunburned faces and ears.\n\nCheck regulations carefully! Some waters change to single-hook-only March 1. Much of the eastern section and other selected area waters close to ALL fishing April 10 through June 7 in order to protect spawning rainbow trout. Check regulations carefully for seasons, bag and size limits, single-hook and fly-fishing-only waters.\n\nResident fish continue to present the only sport fishing opportunity. Fishing for rainbows, Dollies, grayling and pike may be fair to fabulous as the season warms up and the ice opens. Typical ice fishing techniques for trout and Dolly Varden include jigging and tip-ups. It is also legal to spear northern pike through the ice.\n\nWhen waters begin to open, rainbows and Dolly Varden/ Arctic Char feed on freshly-hatched fry, insects and early migrating salmon smolt. Fly patterns imitating small fish, alevins, sculpins, minnows, leeches or egg-sucking leeches (black, brown, or purple) may catch fish. Don't overlook the fluorescent oranges, pinks and greens, which often work very well. Where fishing is allowed in April, small plugs like Fat Raps®, Rapalas®, Bombers®, Wiggle Warts® and the like may work well too - colors from those imitating natural fish to red, all white, or even all black can work. Spoons like Pixees®, Krocodiles®, and Daredevles®, and spinners like Mepps®, and Vibrax® in silver, blue and silver, gold, orange, green, or pink can produce fish. Salmon eggs or other baits work where legal.\n\nThe Naknek River and Kvichak River drainages are the best known early-season bets - but other open waters around the Bay can produce some fishing too.\n\nSmelt fishing is much more enjoyable in March as the days lengthen and the temperatures rise. Always be careful of the ice. Try very small silver or green spoons and jigs.\n\nAs the ice melts from pike waters, the fish feed voraciously in preparation for spawning. Anglers may find some good pike opportunities after mid- to late April. Note the bag and size limits for Bristol Bay pike. Plugs imitating small fish, large silver or colorful spoons, and steel leaders are the tickets for pike.\n\nIn some waters, grayling fishing can be excellent along ice edges. Try standard insect patterns, small (sized 0-2) spinners, and spoons in the standard array of colors."

    "full_text": "May is one of the more unsettled times for Bristol Bay-area weather. All the snow and most of the ice can be gone by May 15, or we could have a late winter/early spring snowstorm. Typically, though, May is pretty temperate, especially the third and fourth weeks. By the end of May, daytime temperatures are usually in the 45-60° F. range, and nighttime temperatures in the 30-40° F. range. River ice is usually gone by May 15, and lower-elevation lake ice by May 25 or 30. Higher elevation lakes and the mountains hold onto their snow until mid-June, and unusually warm days will see river levels rise because of snow melt.\n\nDress in layers to allow for both morning and evening cold and midday warmth. Good rain gear is very useful - as much for a wind breaker as to turn away any cold early season rain.\n\nAt least this time of year the biting bugs are usually scarce; but it doesn't hurt to bring some repellent - we've seen occasional buggy days on the Naknek even in mid-May.\n\nGuides - please remember to register before you head to the bush for the season.\n\nLook for our Pre-season Management Outlook on our web site, in the Anchorage Sport Fish Information Center, or stop by the Dillingham or King Salmon offices for a copy.\n\nMany rivers and lakes are closed to all sport fishing until June 8, and some have different limits until June 8. Some rivers are restricted to unbaited, single-hook, artificial lures only, and some are catch-and-release only for rainbow trout. PLEASE CAREFULLY CHECK THE REGULATIONS! The restrictions are in place to protect and conserve rainbow trout.\n\nThe first salmon to arrive, the king (or chinook) salmon, usually show by the end of the fourth week of May but angling success is usually pretty slow.\n\nBe sure you have your signed king stamp stuck to the back of your sport fishing license BEFORE fishing for king salmon. Anglers who are not required to buy a license must first have a Harvest Record Card before fishing for king salmon, available at license vendors, or at the ADF&G offices. Anglers who MUST have a Harvest Record Card are children under 16 (resident OR non-resident), anglers with the ADF&G Permanent ID Card (senior license) and anglers with the ADF&G Disabled Veteran's License. All other anglers must record their harvest on the back of their fishing license. You will also need a pen with you to record your king salmon harvest immediately.\n\nThis system typically sees the first king salmon catches of the year. Normally, the sport fishery will land about 500 fish by mid-June. High numbers of \"jack\" salmon (smaller males under 20 inches) are normal for the Naknek River.\n\nIn better seasons, the subsistence nets off the beaches near Dillingham or Clark's Point catch kings by mid- to late May. Sport fishing doesn't produce until the kings get into the freshwater of the Nushagak River two to three weeks later. In poor seasons, fishable numbers of kings tend to occur a little later in the season.\n\nThere is an annual limit of 4 kings per angler per season of any size in the Nushagak/ Mulchatna River drainage, and other restrictions apply. Check the regulation booklet carefully before going fishing and don't forget to record a harvested king salmon immediately.\n\nThe Nushagak River drainage king salmon fisheries are guided by the \"Nushagak/Mulchatna Chinook Salmon Management Plan.\" The plan addresses how the subsistence, commercial, and sport fisheries are operated at various escapement levels. Portions of the plan relevant to the sport fishery appear in the regulation booklet. Anglers are encouraged to be familiar with the plan and to be aware that in-season restrictions are likely when the escapement is low.\n\nMay is too early for any sockeye (red), pink, chum, or coho (silver) salmon to return.\n\nReminder: check the regulations before planning your fishing trip. Some rivers do not open to fishing until June 8, some rivers are catch-and-release only, and some have tackle restrictions.\n\nFor early-season fishing, try Lake Clark, or one of Lake Clark's inlet streams. Stay upstream of Sixmile Lake, though, to avoid fishing in closed waters. Lake Clark has northern pike, Arctic grayling, and lake trout. Try trolling spoons and spinners in the narrows just above Sixmile Lake for lakers.\n\nThe lower Naknek River (up to Rapids Camp ADF&G marker) also presents some early season opportunity for rainbow trout, Dolly Varden, grayling, pike, and an occasional lost lake trout.\n\nAnother early season opportunity can be found in the Wood River lakes. As the lakes become ice-free, angling success for Arctic char/Dolly Varden and rainbow trout begins to improve.\n\nGrayling and Arctic char/Dolly Varden are often found feeding on the out-migrating salmon fry. Sparsely-tied alevin patterns, such as Thunder Creeks, and bead-eyed fry patterns work well. Warm days may produce some insect hatches, especially various size stone flies, caddis and midges so go prepared with some nymphs, wets and dries as well.\n\nBy late May, the northern pike are spawning and are voracious. If it's legal gear, bring any top-water buzz bait or popper. If lures are not allowed, any large top-water or weedless sinking fly will work. Now's the time to try those exotic-looking mice and duckling imitations! Don't forget steel leaders, and a hook remover will help to avoid those sharp teeth.\n\nGood places to explore for northerns once the ice has melted are the sloughs between Portage Creek and Ekwok, on the Nushagak River and in the Wood River lakes."

    "full_text": "Early June can be a surprising time in Western Alaska. Some rivers and lakes are wide open, and have been for two weeks or so. Some lakes, though, may still have a lot of ice, making boat traffic difficult. Normal daytime temperatures range from low 40's on a cloudy/ rainy day to mid 60's on a sunny day. Nights are variable, with some dropping into the mid 30's, especially at elevation.\n\nOnce the weather warms up, so do the bugs. Bring plenty of bug repellent, and head nets with “No See Um” mesh are a good idea too.\n\nMost of the Kvichak River drainage (including most waters flowing into Iliamna Lake), the whole Alagnak River drainage, and portions of the Naknek River drainage remain closed to all fishing until June 8. Where the water and seasons are open, such as the lower Naknek River and the central and western portions of the area, there are opportunities to hook a nice fish. Rainbow fishing should be good where open. Other resident species like char, grayling, and northern pike usually provide good fishing opportunities. Pike are usually especially hungry at ice-out. Char and Dolly Varden fishing is usually good wherever out-migrating smolt are found.\n\nAnglers, when visiting any Alaskan small village, please respect the private property and community regulations- a little respect goes a long way to making friends. Please do not fish near subsistence nets - if your hook gets tangled it creates a serious hazard to the owner.\n\nKings begin to show up in early June in the major drainages. Runs build through mid- to late June. The last week of June often sees some excellent king salmon action throughout Bristol Bay drainages. Bristol Bay kings average 20 to 25 pounds, with very few fish exceeding 50 pounds.\n\nFishing for king salmon on the Naknek River is just beginning in early June, with fishing improving over the next few weeks. Normally the sport fishery will land about 500 fish during the first few weeks of the season. The marker buoys and signs showing the closed waters around the outlets of King Salmon and Paul's creeks are installed by June 1. The run builds to a mid- to late June peak, with fish available through mid -July.\n\nThe king run begins about the second week of June, and peaks the last week of June, with fish availability declining steadily after the first week of July. There is a sonar counter on the Nushagak, and estimates are available from the Dillingham office (907) 842-2427.\n\nThe normal daily limit is two (2) per day only one of which may exceed 28 inches in length. There is an annual limit of 4 kings per angler per season of any size in the Nushagak/ Mulchatna River drainage, and other restrictions apply. Check the regulation booklet carefully before going fishing.\n\nThe Nushagak River drainage king salmon fisheries are guided by the “Nushagak/Mulchatna Chinook Salmon Management Plan.” The plan addresses how the subsistence, commercial, and sport fisheries are operated at various escapement levels. Portions of the plan relevant to the sport fishery appear in the regulation booklet. Anglers are encouraged to be familiar with the plan. Open seasons, daily and annual bag limits, legal gear, and waters open to fishing may be changed in-season by Emergency Order to meet objectives of the plan. We recommend calling our recorded hotline at 907-842-7347, checking our Emergency Order website or checking with your favorite Alaskan media outlets for in-season regulation changes before you go fishing.\n\nThe chinook salmon sport fishery in these rivers does not get started until late June and peaks in mid- to late July. The Alagnak kings tend to be a little bigger than fish in other Bristol Bay rivers.\n\nSockeye (red) salmon begin to make their appearance in the Naknek, Kvichak, and Wood rivers by late June. Prime waters to consider by the end of the last week of June are the Egegik River, the Naknek River, the Kvichak River at Igiugig, and possibly the outlet of Ugashik Lake. Better numbers of fish are likely to be available in early to mid-July.\n\nRemember, hooking these hard-to-catch fish in any place other than the mouth constitutes illegal snagging and requires immediate release of the fish. Officers will be patrolling these fisheries. Anglers headed to the Kvichak River drainage (Igiugig, Newhalen, Lake Clark, etc.) should review the “Kvichak River Sockeye Salmon Management Plan” found in the regulation booklet. This plan guides the department in the management of the sport and subsistence fisheries when escapement projections fall below two million fish.\n\nChum salmon are a great game fish, particularly on a fly rod. Bring a good #7 or #8 weight rod, some strong size 4 to 2/0 dark purple and pink or salmon marabou flies, and have a ball. Spoons like pink PixeesTM and orange VibraxTM work well for the spin anglers. While it's a little early yet, good bets should be the Nushagak and Togiak rivers.\n\nCoho and pink salmon do not show up in Bristol Bay sport fisheries during June.\n\nRainbow trout fishing opens up June 8 in the premier eastern section drainages of Kvichak (Iliamna), Alagnak, and Naknek rivers. Flies and lures that imitate migrating sockeye smolt should work well. Fishing in the early morning and late evening hours will generally produce the best results this time of year. Trout fishing success may decline as sockeye enter the rivers, since spawning salmon provide a lot of food for hungry rainbows.\n\nAnglers are reminded of the catch-and-release only regulations for rainbow trout fishing in the Kvichak Alagnak (Branch) and Nonvianuk Rivers drainages.\n\nIn the Naknek River, angling for early rainbow trout is usually good. Anglers are reminded that in the section from Rapids Camp upstream to the lake outlet (Trefon's Cabin), gear is restricted to unbaited single-hook artificial lures with hook gaps of 1/2 inch or less from March 1 through July 31.\n\nOther good early season bets are the Brooks River, the Kvichak River, Togiak River and the Agulowak and Agulukpak rivers.\n\nThere are some excellent opportunities for char in southwest Alaska. These fish are concentrated at stream mouths feeding on out-migrating sockeye salmon smolt and smart anglers will capitalize on that aspect of their life cycle. In most Bristol Bay waters the daily limit is 3 fish with a few more restrictive waters such as the Agulowak River (2/day) and Iliamna River (catch-and-release only). Like the rainbow trout fishery, char success may go down as sockeye salmon plug the rivers.\n\nIn June, grayling feed on the abundant salmon fry that have emerged from the gravel and are migrating downstream. Sparsely-tied alevin patterns like Thunder Creeks, and bead-eyed fry patterns are often good for grayling at this time of the year. Grayling are an added bonus to the fishing experience in these waters. Spending an afternoon catching grayling on light tackle will add to the fishing trip. Soon after the ice is out, some rivers support abundant spring “runs” of grayling moving up to their spawning and feeding areas. Fishing these waters at the right time can produce some spectacular fishing opportunities.\n\nThere are bag limits for pike in Western Alaska - check the regulation booklet carefully. Northern pike are a native species waters, and an important subsistence item. Very good pike fishing can be had right after ice-out in the lakes and in the many side sloughs and slow waters of area rivers. Once the weather heats up, pike become inactive during the day. Fishing early morning or late evenings often provides the best success."

Please do not fish near subsistence nets - if your hook gets tangled it creates a serious hazard to the owner\n\nBears often move onto salmon-plugged streams as the month progresses. Avoid confrontations by keeping a clean camp. Don't clean your fish in camp, and throw carcasses well into the stream. Don't store food in your sleeping areas, and try to set up the cooking area away from sleeping areas, too. Make plenty of noise traveling through brushy areas.\n\nEarly July is often the time when the department issues special in-season regulatory actions (Emergency Orders) on fisheries governed by management plans. Anglers are encouraged to contact the Dillingham regulation recorder at 907-842-REGS (7347) to stay apprised of these emergency orders.\n\nThe first weeks of July usually provide good to excellent action throughout Bristol Bay drainages. Bristol Bay kings average 20 to 25 pounds, with very few fish exceeding 50 pounds. Keep in mind that most drainages close to fishing for king salmon (including catch-and-release) by July 31, and most of the Nushagak and Mulchatna drainages close earlier, on July 25. Anglers who enjoy catch-and-release king fishing are encouraged use single hooks with pinched barbs. There is a new regulation to leave king salmon in the water if you plan to release them.\n\nThe end of the first week of July typically sees the peak of the king run to the Naknek, with fish available through mid-July. Please pay attention to the marker buoys and signs showing the closed waters around the outlets of King Salmon and Paul's creeks.\n\nFish availability declines steadily after the first week of July.

Check the regulation booklet carefully before going fishing and don't forget to record a harvested king salmon immediately.\n\nThe Nushagak River drainage king salmon fisheries are guided by the “Nushagak/Mulchatna Chinook Salmon Management Plan.” The plan addresses how the subsistence, commercial, and sport fisheries are operated at various escapement levels. Portions of the plan relevant to the sport fishery appear in the regulation booklet. Anglers are encouraged to be familiar with the plan. We recommend calling our recorded hotline at 907-842-7347, checking our Emergency Order website or checking with your favorite Alaskan media outlets for in-season regulation changes before you go fishing.\n\nThe chinook salmon sport fisheries in the Alagnak and Togiak rivers normally start slowly the first week of July, and peak by mid-July - a little later than other Bristol Bay waters. As with all other rivers in Bristol Bay, note the 5 king seasonal limit and harvest recording requirements for all anglers. The Alagnak kings tend to be a little bigger than fish in other Bristol Bay rivers.\n\nSockeye (red) salmon are the fish of the month for July. Remember, hooking these hard-to-catch fish in any place other than the mouth constitutes illegal snagging and requires immediate release of the fish. Officers will be patrolling the fisheries. Most runs peak by mid-July, and are pretty much done by the end of July.\n\nSockeye are usually running in good numbers in the Naknek, Nushagak, Kvichak, and Wood rivers by early July. Prime waters to consider are the Egegik, Naknek, Wood, and Alagnak rivers. The outlet of Becharof Lake, and later in the month, the outlet of Ugashik Lake, can also be good.\n\nAnglers headed to the Kvichak River drainage (Igiugig, Iliamna, Newhalen, Lake Clark, etc.) should review the “Kvichak River Sockeye Salmon Management Plan” found in the regulation booklet. This plan guides the department in the management of the sport and subsistence fisheries when escapement projections fall below two million fish.\n\nChum salmon are a great fish, particularly on a fly rod, and are at their most abundant levels by mid-July. Use your #7 or #8 weight rod, some strong size 4 to 2/0 dark purple and pink or salmon marabou flies, and have a great time. Spoons like pink PixeesTM and orange VibraxTM work well for the spin anglers. Good bets should be the Nushagak, Alagnak, and Togiak rivers.\n\nLook for silver salmon to begin returning by late July. Modest opportunities for coho anglers will be found on the lower Nushagak, Wood, and Naknek rivers. Bright pink or orange lures, like size 2 to 4 Tee-SpoonsTM, PixeesTM, VibraxTM, Hot RodsTM, MeppsTM, polar shrimp patterns, and flash flies all work well on coho salmon. Sometimes chartreuse or yellow-green lures work very well on cohos.\n\nAnglers planning coho salmon fishing trips should note that the bag limit for coho in the Kvichak River and the Lake Iliamna drainage (excluding the Alagnak River drainage) is 2/day.\n\nOn even-numbered years, Bristol Bay anglers will find plenty of pink salmon action throughout the area from about mid-July to the end of July. Caught in saltwater, or just after entering freshwater and still bright and silvery, pinks make a great light gear sport fish and provide excellent table fare.\n\nRainbow trout fisheries are fair to excellent in July. In systems with large salmon runs, success for rainbows may decline as the salmon dominate the waterways. Die-hard 'bow anglers welcome the challenge of enticing a rainbow full of salmon eggs to strike a fly. If you are a catch-and-release angler, please consider putting on single hooks and pinching the barbs. This makes it much easier to release fish unharmed..\n\nGood places to try are the Naknek River, the Wood River Lakes system, and the Alagnak River. Flies and lures that imitate insects, salmon eggs, or salmon flesh are your best bets. Fishing in the early morning and late evening hours will generally produce the best results this time of year.\n\nAnglers are reminded that the Board of Fisheries adopted catch-and-release only regulations for rainbow trout fishing in the Alagnak (Branch) and Nonvianuk rivers. In the Naknek River, the section from Rapids Camp upstream to the lake outlet (Trefon's Cabin), gear is restricted to unbaited, single-hook artificial lures with hook gaps of 1/2 inch or less from March 1 through July 31.\n\nThere are some excellent opportunities for Dollies and grayling in southwest Alaska. These fish are concentrated at stream mouths feeding on drifting salmon eggs and flesh. In most Bristol Bay waters the daily limit for Dollies is 3 fish with a few more restrictive waters such as the Agulowak River (2/day) and Iliamna River (catch-and-release only).\n\nResident fish are an added bonus for salmon anglers. Spending an afternoon catching grayling or Dollies on light tackle will add to the fishing trip. Use small (size 0-3) silver and/or orange spinners and spoons, egg imitations, or salmon eggs where allowed. Grayling and some rainbows and Dollies may go for dry flies, bead-headed nymphs, traditional wet flies, and leech imitations.\n\nLike the rainbow trout fishery, char success may go down as sockeye salmon plug the rivers. It may take more skill and patience to outwit full fish.\n\nThere are bag limits for pike in Western Alaska - check the regulation booklet carefully. Northern pike are a native species to our waters, and an important subsistence item. Very good pike fishing can be found in the lakes and in the many side sloughs and slow waters of area rivers, especially early morning and late evening hours. Pike fishing usually tapers off by late July."

    "full_text": "Early fall in Bristol Bay often starts with mild weather, but don't be fooled. Count on stormy periods with rain, wind, and cool temperatures, especially near the end of August. Nighttime temperatures drop to 32 degrees F. or below by mid-September. By late September, ice forms on smaller still waters. The chilly nighttime temperatures are offset by the fine, sunny days, and early fall anglers often agree that there's no better time to be in Bristol Bay. Be sure to come prepared with top-quality raingear and seam-sealed tents. Also, storms or extended rainy periods may cause river levels to change rapidly.\n\nUntil we have several hard frosts, bugs continue to be especially ferocious. Fine-meshed head nets and mesh bug jackets are good items to bring. Bug repellent is almost mandatory, in August especially. Check the screens on your tent, too.\n\nAnglers, when visiting any Alaskan small village, please respect the private property and community regulations and traditions. The respect you show goes a long way to making friends and assuring your return is welcome. Especially be careful around subsistence nets. If your hook gets tangled and broken off, it creates a serious hazard to the owner.\n\nBears are plentiful along salmon streams in August and early September. Avoid confrontations by keeping a clean camp. Don't clean your fish in camp, and throw carcasses well into the stream. It is wise to camp in open areas whenever possible and avoid camping on bear trails. Don't store food in your sleeping areas, and try to set up the cooking area away from sleeping areas. Make plenty of noise traveling through brushy areas and stay alert. The department has a pamphlet called “Bear Facts” that is helpful for bear country visitors.\n\nAnglers are encouraged to contact the Dillingham regulation recorder at 907-842-REGS (907 842-7347) to stay apprised of any emergency order restrictions in effect for the sport fisheries.\n\nSilver (coho) salmon are the “salmon of the month” in Bristol Bay, for both August and September.The first silvers usually appear in the first week of August, in the Naknek and Nushagak/Wood rivers. Other systems that may provide early success include the Alagnak and Egegik rivers. By the end of the second week of August, the Naknek, Nushagak/Wood, and Alagnak runs are close to peak. From mid-August to early September, silver fishing peaks in the Togiak and Ugashik rivers. The Egegik and Alagnak rivers may get a second pulse of fish around the end of the third week of August. After that, a few silvers may be found in various Bristol Bay waters until mid-September, though usually in declining numbers.\n\nSilver salmon runs are notoriously erratic, and anglers planning trips should regularly call the ADF&G Bristol Bay regulation hotline, (907) 842-7347. Management of the Nushagak /Mulchatna drainage silver salmon fishery is governed under the “Nushagak River Coho Salmon Management Plan,” 5 AAC 06.368.\n\nBright pink or orange lures, like sizes 2 to 4 Tee-Spoons™, Pixees™, Vibrax™, Hot Rods™, and Mepps™ all work well for silvers. Fly anglers cast polar shrimp patterns and flash flies, size 2, 4, or 6. Sometimes chartreuse or yellow-green colors work very well, too.\n\nAnglers planning silvers salmon fishing trips should note that the bag limit for silvers in the Kvichak River and the Lake Iliamna drainage (excluding the Alagnak River drainage) is 2/day to protect these small stocks.\n\nA few chum salmon continue to be available through the end of the first week of August. Best places to try are the Naknek, Alagnak and Togiak rivers. Chum are a great fish, particularly on a fly rod. Use your #7- or #8-weight rod, some strong sized 2 to 4 dark purple and hot pink or salmon marabou flies, and have a great time. Spoons like pink Pixees™ and orange Vibrax™ work well for the spin anglers.The sockeye (red) salmon runs are usually past peak by the first of August but a few late, bright fish may be available in some waters.\n\nIn even-numbered years, pink (humpy) salmon often provide some angling opportunities during late July and the first week of August in many Bristol Bay drainages. The pink runs are usually past peak by mid-August.\n\nBy July 31, sport fishing for king salmon is closed by regulation in all Bristol Bay waters. Most of the Nushagak / Mulchatna drainage closes July 25.\n\nThe ADF&G Office in Dillingham can provide a summary of the fishing season by the end of October. In January or February of the new year, look for our “Pre-season Management Outlook.” Both items are posted on our web site.\n\nMid-August to mid-September is the premier season for Bristol Bay rainbow trout. The Bristol Bay rainbow lifecycle is very dependent on spawning salmon, because rainbows fatten up in order to survive winter on the loose eggs and flesh of dying salmon. Precise timing of the peak varies considerably among the different waters. Fishing success is often best as the spawning declines and easy food becomes less available.\n\nDedicated rainbow anglers from around the world come to Bristol Bay seeking the challenge of enticing these big, fat and feisty rainbows - fish at their physical peak - to strike a fly. If you are fishing catch-and-release, please use single hooks, pinch the barbs, and release the fish without removing them from the water. Also, we recommend using stronger gear. A slightly heavier line test minimizes playing time and allows a quick release. These techniques make it much easier to release fish unharmed and available to spawn in spring. Please help us protect this wonderful resource.\n\nGood places to try are the Naknek River, the Wood River Lakes system, most rivers in the Kvichak River drainage, and the Alagnak River. In early August (or anytime before salmon spawning gets going), rainbows may still take dry flies. The Wood River Lakes and the upper Nushagak River are good places to look for this type of action.\n\nFlies and lures that imitate insects, leeches, salmon eggs, or salmon flesh are your best bets, with fluorescent orange the top color choice for lure anglers. This time of year, fly anglers rely on Glo Bugs, Iliamna Pinkies, the all-purpose purple egg sucking leech, flesh flies and similar patterns in sizes 6 to 1. Fishing in the early morning and late evening hours will generally produce the best results this time of year.\n\nA note on tackle regulations: In all Bristol Bay waters, beads must be fixed to the line within 2 inches of the fly, hook, or lure, or be free-sliding on the line/leader. Also, in fly-fishing-only waters, a bead on the line followed by a bare hook is not legal gear. The hook must be some type of fly. This regulation was adopted to reduce injuries to the fish.\n\nAnglers are reminded that the Board of Fisheries adopted catch-and-release only regulations for rainbow trout fishing in flowing waters of the Alagnak (Branch) and Nonvianuk river drainages. In the Naknek River, the section from Rapids Camp upstream to the lake outlet (Trefon's Cabin), gear is restricted to unbaited, single-hook artificial lures with hook gaps of 1/2 inch or less from March 1 through July 31.\n\nThere are excellent opportunities for Dollies and grayling in southwest Alaska. These fish congregate near salmon spawning areas where they feed on drifting salmon eggs and flesh. In most Bristol Bay waters the daily limit for Dollies is 3 fish, although there are a few more restrictive waters, such as the Agulowak River (2/day) and Iliamna River (catch-and-release only).\n\nSea-run (anadromous) Dolly Varden begin showing in the Togiak River by the second week of August. Look for these runs to peak in mid- to late September.\n\nSpending an afternoon catching grayling or Dollies on light tackle can make an excellent fishing trip. Use small (size 0-3) silver and/or orange spinners and spoons, egg imitations, or salmon eggs where allowed. Grayling and some rainbows and Dollies may go for dry flies, or traditional wet flies such as bead-headed nymphs and leech imitations.\n\nLike the rainbow trout fishery, char success may be more difficult during the peak of sockeye salmon spawning. When food is so abundant the fish get picky. It may take more skill and patience to outwit full fish.\n\nThere are bag limits for pike in Western Alaska - check the regulation booklet carefully. Northern pike are a native species to these waters, and an important subsistence fish. Pike inhabit the lakes and the many side sloughs and slow waters of area rivers. Pike move to deeper waters and become less active in the fall, so fishing can be slow from August until ice-up."

    "full_text": "Typical early winter weather includes increasingly colder temperatures, often combined with strong winds, foggy periods, and rain and snow. For hardy anglers, particularly in early October, there may be a few days that are truly enjoyable. Night temperatures may dip to 0° F or below by mid-October, and snow and full winter weather should be expected at any time during these months. Anglers should be equipped for cold to very cold weather. Daylight decreases dramatically during these months and fishing trips may be short forays from warm quarters.\n\nIn spite of the cold weather, most of the area's big lakes and rivers hold too much heat to freeze quickly. Open water, especially around inlets and outlets, continues to provide some angling opportunity. Later, and as the ice thickens, anglers may enjoy some ice fishing opportunities. However, BE VERY CAREFUL. The new ice, erratic temperatures, and currents make ice unsafe during this time.\n\nIn early October and on the first of November, a number of Bristol Bay area regulations \"switch over\" to different bag limits and legal tackle. Please check the regulation booklet before heading out to fish.\n\nA note on tackle regulations: beads must be fixed within 2 inches of the fly or lure, or be free-sliding on the line/leader. Also, in fly-fishing-only waters, a bead on the line followed by a bare hook is not legal gear. You must also use some type of fly.\n\nA few silvers may be found in some Bristol Bay drainages through October. In the eastern section, places to look are the upstream reaches of the Egegik, Ugashik, and Naknek drainages. In the western section, try the Togiak River. The silver runs to the Nushagak/Mulchatna drainages are over by mid-September.\n\nBright pink or orange lures, like size 2 to 4 Tee-Spoons®, Pixees®, Vibrax®, Hot Rods®, Mepps®, polar shrimp patterns, and flash flies all work well on coho salmon. Sometimes chartreuse or yellow-green lures work very well on cohos.\n\nAnglers planning coho salmon fishing trips should note that the bag limit for coho in the Kvichak River and the Lake Iliamna drainage (excluding the Alagnak River drainage) is 2/day.\n\nAll other salmon - pink, chum, red, and king - are rarely available after August. King salmon should start running again in late May.\n\nIn January or February of the new year, look for our \"Pre-season Management Outlook.\"\n\nResident fish dominate the scene in late fall and early winter. Fishing for rainbows, and Arctic char/ Dolly Varden can be good to fabulous until it's too cold to fish. By October, the fish are no longer feeding on salmon eggs or salmon carcasses and they can be hungry for anything that looks like food. Try orange spinners and spoons, dead egg patterns, egg-sucking leeches, flesh flies, other imitations of the salmon lifecycle, and bait (where permitted). Try switching back to insect imitations, both wet and dry, and forage fish imitations like sculpins, muddlers minnows, or silver or bronze spoons, plugs or spinners. Fishing in the mid-morning or warmer afternoon hours may produce the best results this time of year - and its much easier on angler and gear.\n\nGood places to try for rainbow trout are the Naknek River, the Wood River Lakes system, and the Alagnak River. The Kvichak/Iliamna tributaries are excellent prospects if the cold weather doesn't prevent access. The Kvichak River near the community of Igiugig, and the Newhalen River near Iliamna are two of the most accessible fishing opportunities this time of year. Trolling the open waters near the outlets of the larger area lakes can produce nice rainbows. Try Canadian Wonders® or similar spoons. In the central section, rainbows in the Wood River Lakes may be caught well into October, sometimes on dry flies.\n\nThere are also some excellent opportunities for Dolly Varden/Arctic Char and Arctic grayling in most of the rainbow trout waters listed above. Sea-run (anadromous) Dolly Varden begin showing in the Togiak rivers by the late August, peak in September, and may occasionally still be found into October.\n\nIn most Bristol Bay waters the daily limit for Dollies is 3 fish with a few more restrictive waters such as the Agulowak River (2/day) and Iliamna River (catch-and-release only).\n\nWhere they occur in Bristol Bay, this time of year may find a few lake trout near the surface and in near shore waters, providing a special treat for the hardy angler.\n\nRemember the Bristol Bay tackle restrictions regarding the use of beads. Beads must be fixed within 2 inches of the fly or lure, or be free-sliding on the line/leader. Also, in fly-fishing-only waters, a bead on the line followed by a bare hook is not legal gear. You must also use some type of fly.\n\nAnglers are reminded that the Board of Fisheries adopted catch-and-release only regulations for rainbow trout fishing in the Alagnak (Branch) and Nonvianuk Rivers.\n\nThere are bag limits for northern pike in Western Alaska - check the regulation booklet carefully. Northern pike are a native species to our waters, and an important subsistence fish. Pike angling is usually pretty slow this time of year, though it can be a popular time for net fishing by some Nushagak River subsistence fishers.\n\nBy late November, we have enough ice for ice fishing. Smelt, Arctic char / Dolly Varden, pike, rainbow trout, burbot, and lake trout may be taken through the ice with bait or by jigging lures. BE CAREFUL on the new ice."

(Neither the ADF&G Permanent ID license nor the ADF&G Disabled Veteran's license expire.)\n\nThe sport fishing regulations are good through April 15 of the new year. Look for new booklets around the end of March or early April.\n\nHalibut fishing is closed Jan. 1 through Jan. 31, and lingcod fishing outside of Resurrection Bay is closed Jan. 1 through June 30, to protect spawning and nest-guarding adults. Lingcod fishing in Resurrection Bay north of a line between Cape Resurrection and Aialik Cape is closed year round. All lingcod incidentally caught must be landed by hand or with a landing net and released immediately.\n\nOtherwise, when weather permits, hardy anglers may find a few rockfish and smaller halibut.\n\nAnglers leaving from Seward should review the rockfish regulations before heading out. The latitude of Cape Puget is the dividing line between two areas that have different rockfish regulations: 1) Prince William Sound, and 2) The North Gulf Coast (which includes Resurrection Bay).\n\nIn Prince William Sound, anglers must keep the first two non-pelagic rockfish they catch. Daily limits for rockfish, including non-pelagic rockfish are also different in the two areas.\n\nNon-pelagic rockfish – such as “red snapper” – need this additional protection because they rarely survive the change in pressure as they are brought to the surface. Rockfish are extremely long-lived fish, and are slow to reach sexual maturity. Overharvest would quickly reduce the number of mature fish available to spawn. Anglers targeting rockfish are encouraged to fish for black or dusky rockfish in waters less than 10 fathoms (60 feet) so that fish that are released have a fair chance at survival. Also, halibut anglers are strongly encouraged to fish with a single large hook (size 16 or larger) and avoid rocky areas to minimize their unintentional rockfish catch. There’s a handy rockfish ID chart posted on the web, and also printed in our regulation booklet.\n\nSharks are occasionally taken in Resurrection Bay fisheries. The daily bag limit for sharks is one fish of any species, and the annual limit is two sharks of any species. This includes spiny dogfish as well as salmon and sleeper sharks. Sleeper sharks are generally considered inedible and should be released. All harvested sharks must be recorded immediately upon capture on the back of your license or on your Harvest Record Card.\n\nSharks have a high urea content, and are inedible unless handled properly. Bleed your shark immediately upon capture by cutting the underside of the tail, and let the bleeding continue until the heart stops. Gutting the fish with a single cut from the anus to the gills can enhance the quality of the meat.\n\nBag limits “carry over” between areas, and daily limits apply per day, NOT PER AREA. For example, if you keep 2 red snapper (non-pelagic rockfish) east of Cape Puget, then travel west of Cape Puget and stop to fish, you are over your daily limit, because west of Cape Puget the daily limit for non-pelagic rockfish is 1. You may pass through an area on your way back to port, but check the limits if you’re thinking about stopping to fish.\n\nSmall numbers of silver salmon continue to return through the month of October. Try fishing the breakwater near the Seward Small Boat Harbor. Anglers trolling in Resurrection Bay also have a slight chance of picking up a chum salmon or sockeye (red) salmon. The daily bag limits in saltwater for salmon (other than kings) is six.\n\n“Winter” kings may be caught throughout the North Gulf Coast area, and in many nearshore salt waters of Alaska. Also called “feeder” kings, they are cruising the ocean, fattening up before returning to their home stream to spawn. Try using downriggers in at least 60 feet of water, especially near schools of baitfish.\n\nA king salmon stamp IS required before fishing for kings (unless you have the ADF&G Permanent ID Card or the ADF&G Disabled Veteran’s Card, or you are under 16 years old). Kings caught in the North Gulf Coast/Resurrection Bay do not need to be recorded on the back of the license or on the harvest record card.\n\nNorth Gulf Coast is closed to all crabbing due to low population levels. The personal use shrimp pot fishery does not open until April 15.\n\nIn early October, anglers may find a silver salmon or two in the open portion of Resurrection River, which is the only Resurrection Bay fresh water drainage open to salmon fishing. Consult your regulation booklet for details.\n\nMost Resurrection Bay freshwater lakes and streams are open year round to Dolly Varden, rainbow trout, lake trout, and Arctic grayling sport fishing, although fishing success declines dramatically in winter. There are several lakes and streams in the Seward area accessible by road or trail that support resident fish populations. A free handout outlining sport fishing opportunities in the Seward area is available at your local ADF&G office, or on theSouthcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Brochures page.\n\nBy December, the ice on the smaller lakes is usually thick enough for safe travel (6” for foot traffic, 12” for vehicle). Ice conditions are extremely variable from year to year. Some years, there is open water all winter. On other years, however, there can be 3 feet of ice, especially near shore. Drill or chop test holes before going out too far on any ice-covered waterway.\n\nTravel on the ice is at your own risk. ADF&G does not monitor ice thickness."

Also called \"feeder\" kings, they are cruising the ocean, fattening up before returning to their home stream to spawn. Try using downriggers at least 60 feet down, especially near schools of baitfish.\n\nHatchery-released king salmon start returning to Resurrection Bay in April, with first catches coming from the Rugged Island/Fox Island area. These king salmon are returning to two release sites, Lowell Creek and the Seward Lagoon outflow. Lucky beach anglers start to catch a few kings at these two locations in early May.\n\nIn the marine waters inside Resurrection Bay, from May 1 through August 31, the daily limit for king salmon is two, any size. During the rest of the year inside this area, and in the rest of the North Gulf Coast marine waters, the daily bag and possession limit for king salmon is one fish.

Bleed your shark immediately upon capture by cutting the underside of the tail, and let the bleeding continue until the heart stops. Gutting the fish with a single cut from the anus to the gills can enhance the quality of the meat.\n\nHerring are caught in late April/early May by anglers fishing a herring rig (15 or fewer small, unbaited hooks on a single line) in the Seward Small Boat Harbor. Herring are used as both a food fish and a baitfish. There is no bag limit.\n\nHooligan (eulachon/smelt) are caught while returning to spawn in the Resurrection River. There's no limit on hooligan.\n\nIf you're an Alaska resident, you can use a dip net or a small gill net to take hooligan and herring. Check the regulation booklet for net seasons and size limits.\n\nNorth Gulf Coast is closed to all crabbing year-round, due to low population levels. A section of the North Gulf Coast, from Aialik Cape to Gore Point, is open to shrimping from April 15 through September 15. A free permit is required, and this shrimp fishery is open only to Alaska residents. Please see the Southcentral Alaska shellfish regulations for more information.\n\nWith one exception, all fresh waters draining into Resurrection Bay are closed to salmon fishing year-round. The one exception is a portion of the Resurrection River, which is open August 1 through December 31 for salmon fishing. Consult your regulation booklet before you fish these waters.\n\nMost Resurrection Bay freshwater lakes and streams are open year round to Dolly Varden, rainbow trout, lake trout, and Arctic grayling sport fishing.

    "full_text": "Don't forget: your fishing license expired Dec. 31! A sport fishing license makes a great gift - one that lasts all year. (Neither the ADF&G Permanent ID license nor the ADF&G Disabled Veteran's license expire.)\n\nHalibut fishing in the Seward area is generally fair in the month of May. Most fish are in the 20-30 pound range. Catches of larger fish are dependent on the weather. If boats can safely leave Resurrection Bay and head east toward Cape Puget, Montague Strait, Cape Cleare, or Elrington Island, they may come back with one or two halibut in the 100-pound range. Anglers fishing from smaller boats occasionally have success in the deeper waters of Resurrection Bay.\n\nDaily limit is 2 per person, and possession limit is 4 per person. If you hook a fish, it counts toward your limit, regardless of who reels it in.\n\nBy late April to early May, the first returning king salmon are usually landed from anglers fishing from boats near the mouth of Resurrection Bay. Try trolling near Cape Resurrection, Aialik Cape, or in Eldorado Narrows. Herring under a flasher works well. Look for schools of baitfish, or flocks of birds feeding off baitfish, and cast or troll near there.\n\nA few kings \"hit the beach\" near the Seward Lagoon outfall culverts, and near the Lowell Creek waterfall, since that's where they are stocked. During May this beach fishery will be slow, but should pick up as the month progresses. The run peaks in mid- to late June. Shore anglers usually have the highest harvest rates fishing 1-2 hours before and after high tide.\n\nKings can be taken using a variety of lures and bait, as well as by snagging, which is legal in Resurrection Bay salt waters. Anglers also have success trolling for kings near these locations, using herring as bait, and setting a flasher above the lure.\n\nInside Resurrection Bay, from May 1 – August 31, the daily limit for king salmon is two, any size. A king salmon stamp IS required before fishing for kings (unless you have the ADF&G Permanent ID Card or the ADF&G Disabled Veteran's Card, or you are under 16 years old). Outside Resurrection Bay the bag and possession limit for king salmon, year round, is 1 fish, any size.\n\nAnglers trolling in Resurrection Bay in May also have a slight chance of picking up a chum salmon or red (sockeye) salmon.\n\nThere's a chance that shore anglers near Lowell Point will catch an anadromous Dolly Varden or two in mid- to late May. This is a fun surfcasting opportunity, using small spinners and spoons or flies that imitate salmon fry and smolt.\n\nLingcod fishing inside Resurrection Bay, north of a line between Cape Resurrection and Aialik Cape, is closed year round, and lingcod fishing in all other waters does not open until July 1. All lingcod incidentally caught must be landed by hand or with a landing net and released immediately.\n\nAnglers leaving from Seward should review the rockfish regulations before heading out. The latitude of Cape Puget is the dividing line between two areas that have different rockfish regulations: 1) Prince William Sound, and 2) The North Gulf Coast (which includes Resurrection Bay).\n\nIn Prince William Sound, anglers must keep the first two non-pelagic rockfish they catch. Daily limits for rockfish, including non-pelagic rockfish are also different in the two areas.\n\nNon-pelagic rockfish - such as \"red snapper\" - need this additional protection because they rarely survive the change in pressure as they are brought to the surface. Rockfish are extremely long-lived fish, and are slow to reach sexual maturity. Overharvest would quickly reduce the number of mature fish available to spawn. Anglers targeting rockfish are encouraged to fish for black or dusky rockfish in waters less than 10 fathoms (60 feet) so that fish that are released have a fair chance at survival. Also, halibut anglers are strongly encouraged to fish with a single large hook (size 16 or larger) and avoid rocky areas to minimize their unintentional rockfish catch. There's a handy rockfish ID chart posted on the web, and also printed in our regulation booklet.\n\nBag limits \"carry over\" between areas, and daily limits apply per day, NOT PER AREA. For example, if you keep 2 red snapper (non-pelagic rockfish) east of Cape Puget, then travel west of Cape Puget and stop to fish, you are over your daily limit, because west of Cape Puget the daily limit for non-pelagic rockfish is 1. You may pass through an area on your way back to port, but check the limits if you're thinking about stopping to fish.\n\nSharks are occasionally taken in Resurrection Bay fisheries. The daily bag limit for sharks is one fish of any species, and the annual limit is two sharks of any species. This includes spiny dogfish as well as salmon and sleeper sharks. Sleeper sharks are generally considered inedible and should be released. All harvested sharks must be recorded immediately upon capture on the back of your license or on your Harvest Record Card.\n\nSharks have a high urea content, and are inedible unless handled properly. Bleed your shark immediately upon capture by cutting the underside of the tail, and let the bleeding continue until the heart stops. Gutting the fish with a single cut from the anus to the gills can enhance the quality of the meat. Please do not cut off the head or tail until after the fish is landed to ensure that the ADF&G port sampler has an opportunity to obtain measurements.\n\nBeginning in late May, ADF&G has a port sampler stationed in the Seward Small Boat Harbor. The technician interviews returning anglers and samples halibut, rockfish, and sharks for length, weight, sex, and age. You can help by providing information when interviewed and by returning fish carcasses to the harbor for sampling. The information collected by this project is used to monitor the health of the fishery, advise halibut management agencies, and help the Board of Fisheries formulate regulations that protect fish stock and provide maximum fishing opportunity. Contact Dan Bosch in Anchorage at (907) 267-2153 for more information.\n\nHerring are caught in late April/early May by anglers fishing a herring rig (15 or fewer small, unbaited hooks on a single line) in the Seward Small Boat Harbor. Herring are used as both a food fish and a baitfish. There is no bag limit.\n\nNorth Gulf Coast is closed to crabbing year-round, due to low population levels. There is an Alaska-resident-only shrimp pot fishery that opens April 15-September 15. Please check the regulation booklet for complete details.\n\nWith one exception, all freshwaters draining into the Resurrection Bay area are closed year-round to all salmon fishing. The exception is a portion the Resurrection River, which is open August 1 – December 31 for fall salmon fishing. Consult your regulation booklet before fishing this river.\n\nMost Resurrection Bay freshwater lakes and streams are open year round to Dolly Varden, rainbow trout, lake trout, and Arctic grayling sport fishing. There are several lakes and streams in the Seward area accessible by road or trail that support resident fish populations.

    "full_text": "Halibut fishing in the Seward area is typically good throughout June. Most fish are in the 20-30 pound range, with occasional catches of fish up to 200 pounds or more. Larger charter boats fish waters far to the east, including Cape Puget, Montague Strait, Cape Cleare, and Elrington Island. Smaller boats occasionally have good success in the deeper waters of Resurrection Bay, with better fishing east of Cape Resurrection.\n\nEarly June sees the hatchery king salmon run into Resurrection Bay \"hit the beach\" near the Seward Lagoon outfall culverts, and near the Lowell Creek waterfall. This run should peak in mid- to late June. Anglers will have the highest harvest rates fishing 1-2 hours before and after high tide. Kings can be taken using a variety of lures and bait as well as snagging. Anglers also have success trolling for kings near these locations, using herring as bait, and setting a flasher above the lure.\n\nKing salmon can also be found throughout the bay, with the best fishing in the south, or middle section of the bay. You will benefit be using a fish finder to help adjust your trolling depth.\n\nIn Resurrection Bay waters from May 1 – August 31, the daily bag limit in saltwater for king salmon is two, with no size restrictions. In Resurrection Bay waters the rest of the year, and in the rest of North Gulf Coast management area waters all year, the daily bag limit is 1 king salmon. Though a king salmon stamp is required, kings caught in Resurrection Bay do not need to be recorded on the back of the license or harvest record card.\n\nAnglers trolling in Resurrection Bay also have a chance of picking up a chum salmon or sockeye (red) salmon. Anglers fishing the salt waters near the mouth of Resurrection River sometimes have fair success snagging red salmon as the fish attempt to return to the Bear Creek weir. Mid-June anglers trolling for kings in outer Resurrection Bay waters often report chum salmon in their catch. By the end of June, trollers outside of Resurrection Bay sometimes pick up a few silvers in the Pony Cove/ Cheval Narrows area.\n\nPink salmon return to many of the bay's freshwater streams by late June. They provide excellent action on light tackle, and aren't bad eating if you catch them fresh and silvery, and cook them right away.\n\nThe daily bag limits in saltwater for salmon (other than kings) is six.\n\nWith the exception of a portion of the Resurrection River (consult the regulation booklet before fishing this river), all Resurrection Bay freshwater drainages are closed year-round to salmon fishing.\n\nRockfish fishing is typically good all summer. By slowly retrieving a black (pelagic) rockfish, the entire school can often be lured to the surface for excellent shallow-water action. Rockfish can usually be released without injury if caught in less than 60 feet of water.\n\nAnglers should review the rockfish regulations before they head out. Additional protection is needed for non-pelagic species because of their extreme longevity and low productivity. Anglers targeting rockfish are encouraged to fish for black or dusky rockfish in waters less than 10 fathoms (60 feet) to minimize mortality of released fish.\n\nThe daily bag limit in waters near Seward (Gore Point to Cape Puget) is four rockfish, no more than one of which may be a non-pelagic species. Consult the chart on page 10 of the Southcentral Sport Fishing Regulation Summary to identify non-pelagic species. The bag limit in Prince William Sound (east of Cape Puget) is five rockfish, no more than two of which may be non-pelagic species, and you must retain the first two non-pelagic species you catch.\n\nAnglers are cautioned that bag limits apply to the waters you are fishing. Therefore, if you retain a bag limit of two non-pelagic rockfish while fishing east of Cape Puget and then fish in waters west of Cape Puget, you are in violation of the bag limit for the waters you are fishing. Halibut anglers are strongly encouraged to fish with a single large hook (size 16 or larger) and avoid rocky areas to minimize their unintentional rockfish catch.\n\nRemember, it is illegal to fish for, or harvest, lingcod until July 1, and Resurrection Bay is closed to lingcod fishing year-round north of a line from Aialik Cape to Cape Resurrection. Targeting lingcod, even for catch and release, is not allowed. All lingcod incidentally caught must be landed by hand or with a landing net and released immediately.\n\nThe daily bag limit for sharks is one fish of any species, and the annual limit is two sharks of any species. This includes spiny dogfish as well as salmon and sleeper sharks. Sleeper sharks are generally considered inedible and should be released. All harvested sharks must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record.

Gutting the fish with a single cut from the anus to the gills can enhance the quality of the meat.\n\nThe Division of Sport Fish collects data from the recreational bottomfish fishery in the Seward boat harbor. A fishery technician interviews returning anglers and samples halibut, rockfish, lingcod, and sharks for length, weight, sex, and age statistics. You can help by providing information when interviewed and by returning fish carcasses to the harbor for sampling by the technicians.

Contact Dan Bosch in Anchorage at (907) 267-2153 for additional information.\n\nNorth Gulf Coast is closed to all crabbing due to low population levels. One section of the North Gulf Coast, from Aialik Cape west to Gore Point, is open to shrimping, by Alaska residents only, with a permit. This pot fishery is open from April 15 - September 15.\n\nThe Resurrection River drainage downstream of the Seward Highway and Nash Road does not open to salmon fishing until August 1. If you are fishing this area for salmon, you must be on the ocean side of the ADF&G markers located at the mouth of the Resurrection River.\n\nMost Resurrection Bay freshwater lakes and streams are open year round to Dolly Varden, rainbow trout, lake trout, and Arctic grayling sport fishing.

The long-term average size for halibut in July is 23-27 pounds, with about 10% of the harvest above 50 pounds.\n\nThe tail end of the run of the early hatchery king salmon usually provides a short spurt of action for beach and boat anglers in the first week of July.\n\nSilver salmon return to Resurrection Bay in large numbers. By early July, silver salmon are usually caught in outer Resurrection Bay waters: Pony Cove, Sunny Cove, and Eldorado Narrows. Try trolling in fairly shallow waters with hoochies, squid, or herring near areas of bird and baitfish activity. Change depths often to get into fish. Some anglers also have good success mooching. Don't look for the beach silver salmon fisheries to “heat up” until mid- to late August. When the silvers finally hit the beach, fishing is usually excellent.\n\nIn even-numbered years (2006, 2008, 2010), pink salmon should begin showing up in salt waters near Spring and Tonsina creeks and in Thumb Cove by mid-July.\n\nThe daily bag limit for kings is two and the daily bag limit for salmon other than kings is six.\n\nWith the exception of the Resurrection River, all freshwater drainages flowing into Resurrection Bay are closed year-round to all salmon fishing.\n\nTossing small spinners off the beach near Lowell Point may produce a Dolly Varden or two.\n\nRockfish fishing is typically good all summer.

Catch rates can sometimes drop in mid-August as larger fish disperse from summer feeding areas. The average weight of harvested halibut should be around 25 pounds.\n\nAugust is the month for silver salmon in Resurrection Bay. Silvers return to Resurrection Bay in large numbers, and the run is enhanced by hundreds of thousands of smolt stocked annually by the Division of Sport Fish and by private, non-profit hatcheries. The stocking should produce an annual return of 20,000 enhanced silvers.\n\nExpect early catches from Pony Cove, Eldorado Narrows, and on the western side of Fox Island. Silvers move up the bay nearer to Caines Head by mid-August, and usually hit the Seward beaches around the third or fourth week of August. Trolling near both shorelines in Resurrection during August produces some very good silver catches. If you have never fished from your boat in this bay, follow the other boats. Shore anglers can try the Lowell Creek waterfall, the Seward Lagoon outfall culverts, and the salt waters in front of Fourth of July Creek. While many shore anglers are snagging (which is legal in Resurrection Bay), many also use lures and have good luck. The perennial Alaskan favorite for silvers is the PixeeTM spoon, but almost any shiny lure or flashy fly will work. This is also a good time to troll off the Seward beaches to target these stocked fish.\n\nThe Seward Silver Salmon Derby runs from about the second Saturday in August through the third Sunday in August. Expect crowded conditions for this popular derby. A little extra courtesy and patience in busy times helps everyone have a better time fishing.\n\nDon’t forget that, with the exception of a portion of the Resurrection River, all fresh waters draining into Resurrection Bay are closed year-round to salmon fishing.\n\nA few pink salmon return to many Resurrection Bay area streams, and present a fun saltwater opportunity. Try the mouths of Spring and Tonsina creeks.\n\nDaily bag and possession limits for salmon (other than kings) are 6 per day. Inside Resurrection Bay, all six of your daily bag limit may be silver (coho) salmon. Outside of Resurrection Bay, you may still keep 6 salmon, but only 3 of them may be silver salmon. Daily bag and possession limits for kings are two, any size.\n\nTossing small spinners or fishing a piece of cut herring off the beach near Lowell Point may produce a Dolly Varden or two in early August.\n\nRockfish fishing should continue to be good.

Many of the adult fish have started their offshore migration, and many anglers turn their attentions to silver salmon during this time, but those who persist may have success. Anglers can expect to catch mostly small halibut inside Resurrection Bay, with better fishing in outside waters. Fall storms and rough marine conditions are also more frequent this time of the year.\n\nSilver salmon are still plentiful in Resurrection Bay throughout September. Shore-based anglers will have success fishing the incoming tides near the Lowell Creek waterfall and the Seward Lagoon outfall culverts. Another good place to try is the breakwater near the Seward Small Boat Harbor. The daily bag limits in saltwater for salmon (other than kings) is six.\n\nThere may also be a few silver salmon left in the fresh waters of the Resurrection River (see freshwater opportunities, below, for more details).\n\nLingcod fishing in Resurrection Bay north of a line between Cape Resurrection and Aialik Cape is closed year round. All lingcod incidentally caught must be landed by hand or with a landing net and released immediately. Closures are necessary in order to protect spawning fish and populations with low abundance.\n\nLingcod fishing outside Resurrection Bay can be good during September, but again, is weather-dependent.\n\nAnglers leaving from Seward should review the rockfish regulations before heading out. The latitude of Cape Puget is the dividing line between two areas that have different rockfish regulations: 1) Prince William Sound, and 2) The North Gulf Coast (which includes Resurrection Bay).\n\nIn Prince William Sound, anglers must keep the first two non-pelagic rockfish they catch. Daily limits for rockfish, including non-pelagic rockfish are also different in the two areas.\n\nNon-pelagic rockfish – such as “red snapper” – need this additional protection because they rarely survive the change in pressure as they are brought to the surface. Rockfish are extremely long-lived fish, and are slow to reach sexual maturity. Overharvest would quickly reduce the number of mature fish available to spawn. Anglers targeting rockfish are encouraged to fish for black or dusky rockfish in waters less than 10 fathoms (60 feet) so that fish that are released have a fair chance at survival. Also, halibut anglers are strongly encouraged to fish with a single large hook (size 16 or larger) and avoid rocky areas to minimize their unintentional rockfish catch. There’s a handy rockfish ID chart posted on the web, and also printed in our regulation booklet.\n\nSharks are occasionally taken in Resurrection Bay fisheries. The daily bag limit for sharks is one fish of any species, and the annual limit is two sharks of any species. This includes spiny dogfish as well as salmon and sleeper sharks. Sleeper sharks are generally considered inedible and should be released. All harvested sharks must be recorded immediately upon capture on the back of your license or on your Harvest Record Card.\n\nSharks have a high urea content, and are inedible unless handled properly. Bleed your shark immediately upon capture by cutting the underside of the tail, and let the bleeding continue until the heart stops. Gutting the fish with a single cut from the anus to the gills can enhance the quality of the meat. Please don’t discard the head or tail until after the fish is brought back to port, so that the ADF&G port sampler has an opportunity to obtain measurements.\n\nBag limits “carry over” between areas, and daily limits apply per day, NOT PER AREA. For example, if you keep 2 red snapper (non-pelagic rockfish) east of Cape Puget, then travel west of Cape Puget and stop to fish, you are over your daily limit, because west of Cape Puget the daily limit for non-pelagic rockfish is 1. You may pass through an area on your way back to port, but check the limits if you’re thinking about stopping to fish.\n\nThrough mid-September, ADF&G has a port sampler stationed in the Seward Small Boat Harbor. The technician interviews returning anglers and samples halibut, rockfish, and sharks for length, weight, sex, and age. You can help by providing information when interviewed and by returning fish carcasses to the harbor for sampling. The information collected by this project is used to monitor the health of the fishery, advise halibut management agencies, and help the Board of Fisheries formulate regulations that protect fish stocks and provide maximum fishing opportunity. Contact Dan Bosch in Anchorage at (907) 267-2153 for more information.\n\nNorth Gulf Coast is closed to all crabbing due to low population levels. The North Gulf Coast, between Aialik Cape and Gore Point, is open to shrimping, by Alaska residents only, with a permit. This pot fishery closes September 15.\n\nThe Resurrection River drainage downstream of the Seward Highway and Nash Road remains open to salmon fishing, and anglers should expect fair fishing throughout September. All other streams are closed year-round to salmon fishing.\n\nMost Resurrection Bay freshwater lakes and streams are open year round to Dolly Varden, rainbow trout, lake trout, and Arctic grayling sport fishing. There are several lakes and streams in the Seward area accessible by road or trail that support resident fish populations. A free handout outlining sport fishing opportunities in the Seward area is available at your local ADF&G office, or on theSouthcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Brochures page."

Look for new booklets in early April.\n\nRainbow trout fishing on the flowing waters in the ice-covered months should be good to excellent. Look for trout in the deeper pools and side-sloughs, and be sure your hole is marked well, and off the usual snowmachine trails. Watch out for areas of overflow. Also keep in mind that most of the flowing waters are single-hook and no bait. Remember, Montana Creek, Willow Creek and the North Fork of the Kashwitna River are catch-and-release only for rainbow trout and grayling, except that in Willow Creek upstream of the Parks Highway bridge, 1 rainbow trout less than 16 inches long is allowed daily.\n\nOnce lake ice is safe enough for travel (6 inches of clear ice for foot traffic, 12 inches for vehicle), ice fishing is usually great on the area's many stocked lakes. Beware! Ice thickness can vary widely from system to system, and travel on the ice is at your own risk. ADF&G does not monitor ice thickness. For ice and snow pack conditions on state lands, call Alaska State Parks in Palmer at (907) 745-3975.\n\nA few lakes are stocked for winter ice fishing, usually sometime in late October or early November. Anglers can check the status of the lake by using the stocking database on our website. The web pages also have links to maps of the area's stocked lakes. You can also find a listing of stocked lakes in the regulation booklet. Remember the limit for rainbow trout in stocked lakes is 5 fish per day (of which only one may be over 20 inches).\n\nJig lures or lower bait (if allowed) near drop off areas and areas of underwater contours for rainbow trout and catchable salmon. The more popular baits include fresh (not frozen) cocktail shrimp, canned clams, single salmon eggs, or preserved salmon egg clusters.

Pike are also to be found in Flathorn, Sucker and Eightmile lakes.\n\nPike respond well to decoys, shiny silver jigs, and lures through the ice. Check the regs before you use bait. Where bait is allowed, chunks of herring work well, and whole sardines or hooligan.\n\nThere are many lakes where using 5 lines through the ice is legal for pike. Check the reg book, or visit the Pike Page on our website. Also when pike fishing through the ice anglers may use two hooks on a single line, provided that both hooks are attached to one single piece of bait.\n\nA handout describing the Pike Fisheries in the Mat-Su area is available at department offices in Anchorage and Palmer.\n\nAgain, ice thickness is not monitored by ADF&G. The Susitna Flats Game Refuge is closed to motorized vehicles until there is 12 inches of snow atop 12 inches of frozen ground.

    "full_text": "The Susitna River is usually ice-free by mid-May, which prompts a few early season anglers begin launching from Deshka Landing and Susitna Landing.\n\nMany of the low-lying lakes become free of ice by mid-May. If the winter has been a particularly cold one, don't expect the higher-elevation lakes, or the more northerly lakes, to break up until after Memorial Day. Once the lakes are free of ice, they will go through the process of spring “turnover,” during which water temperatures become uniform and spring winds mix nutrients and oxygen throughout the water column. Major food items for fish, specifically insect larva, begin to emerge from the lake bottom and fish become very active.\n\nKing salmon start to make their appearance in a few Northern Cook Inlet streams by mid- to late May. The waters downstream of Burma Landing on the Little Susitna River, the mouth of Alexander Creek, and the mouth of the Deshka River are the first places anglers report catches, usually by the end of the second week in May.\n\nAlthough it is still early for large numbers of king salmon to be present in Northern Cook Inlet waters, increasing numbers will be entering freshwater rivers on each high tide. A patient angler in mid-May who is willing to put in the time may be rewarded with an early season king salmon. By the end of May, kings usually have traveled as far as Lake Creek off the Yentna River, and few may even show up at the Willow Creek confluence.\n\nBy mid-May, a few kings arrive in West Cook Inlet streams, but fishing doesn't heat up until June.\n\nEach stream has its own regulations, so careful attention to the regulation booklet is required.\n\nDuring the month of May, rainbow trout that have wintered over in the lakes, or the deeper pools start to move out in search of spawning grounds, and then food. Spawning trout are very vulnerable to harvest. For this reason, there are many waters closed entirely to sport fishing, and many waters closed to the retention of rainbows. Please check the regulation booklet carefully.\n\nArea lakes present a great fishing opportunity. Many species of native and hatchery fish are present, and are often hungry in May. The stocking truck also makes its rounds by late May. Mat-Su valley lakes are stocked with either rainbow trout, landlocked salmon, Arctic grayling, lake trout, or Arctic char, or some combination of these fish. Be sure to check the regulation booklet closely before fishing, since a few lakes have tackle and bait restrictions and open and closed seasons.\n\nPike fishing is usually excellent throughout the month of May, as spawning fish congregate in shallow areas. For road-accessible pike fishing try the Nancy Lake Canoe System lakes. For fly-in pike fishing try Alexander, Eightmile and Sucker lakes.\n\nThe Susitna River hooligan run begins in early May. By mid-May, excellent catches are usually reported downstream of the Yentna-Susitna confluence. In late May, try the Susitna River just downstream of the mouth of Willow Creek."

    "full_text": "June is the “king salmon month” in the Northern Cook Inlet area.\n\nBy early June, king salmon begin to move into the clear water streams of the Susitna River drainage. This early, highest catch rates are usually from Alexander Creek, Deshka River and the Little Susitna River. By the second week of June, kings may also be as far as the Yentna and the Talachulitna. By the third week of June, a few kings are caught at the mouth of Willow Creek. As June wears on, king fishing improves in the Parks Highway streams. Willow, Little Willow, Sheep, Caswell, Birch, Goose, Grey's, Kashwitna, and Montana Creeks downstream of their Parks Highway bridges, and the lower quarter mile of Rabideux, Sunshine, and Trapper creeks are popular places to try.\n\nWillow Creek and the other Parks Highway roadside streams are open to king fishing from Jan. 1 through the third Monday in June, and then the following two weekends. When fishing is open, it is allowed 24-hours-per-day. A weekend is Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. Check the regulations carefully.\n\nThe Little Susitna River continues to produce fair to good catches of king salmon through June, with most of the fishing occurring from the Little Susitna Public Use Facility upstream to the Parks Highway. By late June, fishing is good near the Parks Highway bridge.\n\nPeak fishing at the mouth of the Deshka River is usually between June 8 and 15. After that, fish are still available if you are willing to travel upstream. The Deshka River is open to the retention of king salmon for the first 19 miles, which is indicated by a marker at Chijuk Creek. A word of caution:there is a weir at river mile 7. Please slow down when crossing the weir. If you are uncomfortable running your boat over the weir a fishery technician will be available to guide you. Weir counts are available on our web pages.\n\nBy mid-June, the mouth of Alexander Creek is winding down. A few kings may still be passing through the lower river. Fishing is allowed in the first seven miles as indicated by a marker at Trail Creek.\n\nIn mid-June, catch rates should be good at Lake Creek (Yentna), but expect to share the holes with lots of anglers. Try fishing some of the smaller tributaries and sloughs off the Yentna and Skwentna rivers: Moose Creek, Indian Creek, Fish Lake Creek, Hewitt Creek, Eight-Mile Creek and Canyon Creek. The Talachulitna River may also provide fair fishing by mid-June. Remember: Lake Creek is a fast water system with lots of sweepers. Only about the first three miles of this system are boatable, so exercise extreme caution when boating upstream of the mouth.\n\nBy mid-June, kings are caught at Clear Creek off the Talkeetna River, although this run usually doesn't peak until the last week in June.\n\nAs for the West Cook Inlet streams, the Theodore River is open to catch-and-release king fishing and should provide plenty of action by mid-June, once water levels settle from high country melt-off. The Chuit River is also a popular destination. Remember: the king salmon season closes for the West Cook Inlet streams on June 30.\n\nThe general area king salmon fishing regulations, which establish a five fish seasonal limit and prohibit the use of bait remain in effect. Anglers must record all king salmon harvests on the back of their fishing license or on their harvest record card.\n\nFlowing waters in the Palmer-Wasilla Zone do not open to fishing until June 15. The westside Susitna tributary streams, and the Parks Highway roadside streams from Willow Creek on north are open to fishing, but in waters where retention is allowed, rainbow trout cannot be retained until June 15.\n\nOnce fishing does open, rainbow trout and grayling are available in the majority of these drainages. These streams are often a fly-fishers paradise, if you can hike above the king salmon anglers and do a good roll cast.\n\nRemember, only catch-and-release fishing is allowed year-round when fishing for rainbow trout and grayling on Montana and Willow drainages.\n\nIn June, those Mat-Su lakes that are scheduled for stocking have been stocked with beautiful rainbow trout and grayling. Check the web pages for the latest info on where the stocking truck has been. There is a listing of stocked lakes in the regulation booklet. Remember the limit for rainbow trout in stocked lakes is 5 fish per day (of which only one may be over 20 inches).\n\nOnly 2 trout may be harvested in lakes having native trout populations. A stocked lake handout is available from Department of Fish and Game offices in Palmer and Anchorage to assist you in finding good angling opportunities.\n\nPike are generally found in shallow water areas. Water temperatures in these shallow areas tend to be fairly warm throughout the day. As the water warms, pike become lethargic and are usually off the bite. For better success, try fishing for pike early mornings or late evenings. Try top water weedless lures and flies in the heavily vegetated bays and sloughs.\n\nIn June, pike fishing continues to be good although the spawning event is over for the year. For road accessible pike fishing try the Nancy Lake Canoe System lakes, or Memory, Long, and Prator lakes. River anglers can try the slow side sloughs of Willow Creek. For fly-in pike fishing try Hewitt, Whiskey, Figure Eight, Vern and Donkey, Alexander, Eightmile and Sucker lakes.\n\nA handout describing the Pike Fisheries in the Mat-Su area is available at department offices in Anchorage and Palmer.\n\nBy early June, the Susitna River Hooligan run is well under way. Excellent catches are reported in the Yentna River and in the Susitna River upstream of the Yentna-Susitna confluence. Fishing should continue to be fair through the closure June 15. If you don't have access to a boat try the Susitna River just downstream of the mouth of Willow Creek.\n\nOnly Alaskan residents are allowed to use a dipnet to fish for hooligan. No permit is required, but you must have your sport fishing license in your possession."

    "full_text": "Silver salmon are the fish of the month in the northern Cook Inlet area. By early August, road system anglers can still find lots of silvers in the lower Little Susitna River (near the Public Use Facility), at the Eklutna Power Plant tailrace, and at the mouth of Cottonwood Creek. Boat anglers will find early silvers at the mouths of the Alexander and Deshka rivers, and in Yentna river tributaries such as Lake Creek.\n\nMid-August sees silvers in good numbers in the upper Little Susitna River, Jim Creek, and the Eklutna tailrace, and in good numbers at the mouths of Willow and Little Willow creeks. The rest of the Parks Highway roadside streams - Sheep, Montana, Rabideux, Birch, Goose, Sunshine, and Caswell - should be excellent fishing by the third week of August, through early September.\n\nAnglers with boats should be at the mouth of the Deshka River by early August for some excellent action. Try fishing the tributaries of No-name, Trapper and Chijuk creeks as coho tend to congregate in these areas. Good to excellent fishing for coho can be expected in Alexander Creek, and the Yentna River tributaries such as Lake Creek, Indian Creek, and Hewitt Creek. But by the end of the third week of August, anglers in these systems will have to go upstream to find the fish.\n\nAlso by early to mid-August, there are usually lots of silvers showing up in such West Cook Inlet streams as the Theodore, Chuit and Lewis rivers. By mid-August, the Talachulitna River is also fishable for silvers.\n\nBy the second week of August, the silvers will have moved up as high as the Talkeetna River and such tributaries as Clear Creek, and by the third week in August fishing gets very good.\n\nFor the most successful fishing, try using salmon roe on your spoon or spinner. Pixees™, Vibrax™, and the \"yarn fly\" are perennial Alaskan favorites. Early morning usually providing the best catch rates.\n\nRemember, on the Little Susitna River you are allowed to use bait starting August 6, and catch-and-release fishing for coho salmon is prohibited once you retain a bag limit (2) of coho salmon on the Little Susitna River downstream of a ADF&G regulatory marker located at river mile 32.5. Also, Cottonwood Creek is a weekend-only fishery and fishing is only allowed between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.\n\nEarly August sees a small run of sockeye salmon at the Eklutna Power Plant tailrace, Jim Creek, and out at Cottonwood Creek. Expect the sockeye salmon run to end by the last week of August.\n\nOn even-numbered years, hundreds of thousands of pink salmon can be found in Northern Cook Inlet streams through the month of August. Good numbers of chum salmon also return in early to mid-August.\n\nRainbow trout fishing should be great for the Parks Highway streams. This time of year rainbow trout tend to congregate behind spawning king salmon to feed on eggs. For fly fishing, try using those egg patterns that most resemble king salmon eggs and egg-sucking leeches. If you prefer spinning gear try using an orange or number 1 or 2 Vibrax™, or Mepps™ spinners. On all of these roadside streams, when fishing upstream of their Parks Highway bridges only single-hook, unbaited, artificial lures may be used. Remember, Montana Creek, Willow Creek and the North Fork of the Kashwitna River are catch-and-release only for rainbow trout and grayling.\n\nLake fishing in August is excellent, especially in early morning and late evening hours. There is a listing of stocked lakes in the regulation booklet. Remember the limit for rainbow trout in stocked lakes is 5 fish per day (of which only one may be over 20 inches).\n\nOnly 2 trout may be harvested in lakes having native trout populations. A stocked lake handout is available from Department of Fish and Game offices in Palmer and Anchorage to assist you in finding good angling opportunities.\n\nPike are generally found in shallow water areas. Water temperatures in these shallow areas tend to be fairly warm throughout the day. As the water warms, pike become lethargic and are usually off the bite. For better success, try fishing for pike early mornings or late evenings. Try top water weedless lures and flies in the heavily vegetated bays and sloughs.\n\nIn August, pike fishing continues to be good, and can be very good by the end of August, when temperatures cool down. For road accessible pike fishing try the Nancy Lake Canoe System lakes, or Memory, Long, and Prator lakes. River anglers can try the slow side sloughs of Willow Creek. For fly-in pike fishing try Hewitt, Whiskey, Figure Eight, Vern and Donkey, Alexander, Eightmile and Sucker lakes.\n\nA handout describing the Pike Fisheries in the Mat-Su area is available at department offices in Anchorage and Palmer."

    "full_text": "Small numbers of silver salmon continue to be available in Northern Cook Inlet fresh waters through the end of the third week of September. Best success comes from the Talkeetna River drainage, with most anglers concentrated at Clear Creek.\n\nWillow Creek, Montana Creek, and the Eklutna Power Plant tailrace also usually see a few late silvers trickling in through mid-September. Jim Creek also has a late run of silvers through October.\n\nIn early September, fair to good silver fishing can be found in the tributaries and sloughs of the Yentna and Skwentna rivers. Most anglers try at Moose, Indian, Bottle, or Hewitt creeks. Fishing success tails off by the end of September.\n\nFair to good silver fishing should continue through mid-September in such West Cook Inlet streams as the Theodore, Chuit, and Lewis rivers.\n\nNOTE: Starting September 1, no bait is allowed in most of the Mat-Su valley flowing waters, and in the West Cook Inlet area flowing waters. This does not include the Eklutna Power Plant tailrace (Knik River drainage). Also starting September 1, many waters go to single-hook, no treble/multiple hooks allowed. A single hook has only 1 point, with or without a barb. Check the regulation booklet for a complete description of the area before you go fishing.\n\nPixees™, Vibrax™, and the “yarn fly” are perennial Alaskan favorites for silver salmon. Good single-hook fly choices include flesh flies, sparkle shrimp, and egg-sucking leeches, sizes 2 through 6. Popular colors for both flies and lures are pinks, oranges and chartreuse/greens. Early morning usually providing the best catch rates.Rainbow Trout - Flowing Waters\n\nRainbow trout fishing should be good to excellent until water levels drop and it's just too cold to fish. When water levels go down, look for trout in the deeper pools and side-sloughs, or in lakes. Keep in mind the single-hook, no bait restrictions for much of the flowing waters. Remember, Montana Creek, Willow Creek and the North Fork of the Kashwitna River are catch-and-release only for rainbow trout and grayling, except that in Willow Creek upstream of the Parks Highway bridge, 1 rainbow trout less than 16 inches long is allowed daily.\n\nOnce lake ice is safe enough for travel (6 inches of clear ice for foot traffic, 12 inches for vehicle), ice fishing is usually great on the area's many stocked lakes. Travel on the ice is at your own risk. Ice thickness can vary widely from system to system. ADF&G does not monitor ice thickness. For ice and snow pack conditions on state lands, call Alaska State Parks in Palmer at (907) 745-3975.\n\nA few lakes are stocked specifically for winter ice fishing, usually sometime in late October or early November. Anglers can check the status of the lake by using the stocking database on our website. The web pages also have links to maps of the area's stocked lakes. You can also find a listing of stocked lakes in the regulation booklet. Remember the limit for rainbow trout in stocked lakes is 5 fish per day (of which only one may be over 20 inches).\n\nJig lures or bait (if allowed) near drop off areas for rainbow trout and catchable salmon. For lake trout/char, fish the bottom of the deepest hole you can find. Some lakes have more restrictive tackle and bag limits, please check the regulations before you head out to fish.\n\nOnly 2 trout may be harvested in lakes having native trout populations. A stocked lake handout is available from Department of Fish and Game offices in Palmer and Anchorage to assist you in finding good angling opportunities.\n\nPike fishing success will improve until water levels drop, then taper off until ice fishing season. For road-accessible pike fishing, try South Rolly, Tanaina, and Memory lakes. For fly-in or snowmachine-in pike fishing, it's hard to beat Alexander and Trapper lakes. Pike are also to be found in Sucker and Eightmile lakes.\n\nPike respond well to decoys, jigs, and lures through the ice. Check the regs before you use bait.\n\nThere are certain lakes where using 5 lines through the ice is legal for pike. Check the reg book, or click on the pike pages on our website.\n\nA handout describing the Pike Fisheries in the Mat-Su area is available at department offices in Anchorage and Palmer."

Check the Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summarybookletfor specific regulations or call the Soldotna ADF&G office at (907) 262-9368\n\nThe Upper Kenai and Russian rivers are closed to fishing from May 1 through June 10.\n\nJust want to try out that new fishing rod? Parts of Kenai Lake, Skilak Lake, and all stocked lakes remain open to fishing for rainbow trout the entire year. The Kasilof River is open to fishing for rainbow/Steelhead trout the entire year. The Kasilof River is catch-and-release only for rainbow/steelhead trout and fish may not be removed from the water.\n\nAlthough river conditions in May can be highly variable, generally water levels are extremely low in the Kenai and Kasilof rivers. If it has been an unusually warm spring, water levels may rise closer to normal. Lake ice begins to recede and is normally gone by Memorial Day weekend, except on higher-elevation lakes.\n\nChinook salmon represent the only Northern Kenai Peninsula freshwater salmon fishing opportunity for the month of May. In the Kasilof River, small numbers of Chinook salmon are usually available beginning mid-May, with the run building through the month into June. Through May 15, only single-hook, unbaited, artificial lures are allowed below the Sterling Highway Bridge. After May 15, bait and multiple hooks are allowed. Crooked Creek, a tributary to the Kasilof River, is closed to fishing for Chinook salmon year-round.  Be sure to check the ADF&G website for anyemergency ordersthat may affect this sport fishery.\n\nSmall numbers of Chinook salmon begin to enter the Kenai River in early to mid-May, with increasing numbers through the end of May. The Division of Sport Fish operates a Chinook salmonsonar siteon the mainstem near river mile 14, which generate daily estimates of Chinook salmon passage. These counts are available on the ADF&Gfish counts webpageand generally begin being posted around May 20 each year. Waters of the Kenai River downstream of Skilak Lake are open to Chinook salmon fishing in May. There are some closed areas of the river, special tackle restrictions, length restrictions, annual limits, and specific bag and possession limits for early-run Chinook salmon. Please check the Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summarybookletcarefully as well as currentemergency ordersthat may affect the sport fishery.\n\nKenai River shore anglersmay find success fishing the flooding tide from Cunningham Park in Kenai, or near the Warren Ames Bridge. Upriver in Soldotna, shore anglers cast from the boardwalks at the Soldotna Visitor's Center, Soldotna Creek Park, or from the City of Soldotna's Centennial or Swiftwater campgrounds. Another opportunity for spring fishing is surf casting into the saltwaters of Cook Inlet. The City of Kenai parking area on the north shore, off Spruce Drive in Kenai provides beach access to Cook Inlet and the mouth of the Kenai River. Bait and treble/multiple hooks may be used in saltwater year-round. In freshwaters of the Kenai River, bait is prohibited until July 1, and treble/multiple hooks are not allowed until August 1. Be sure to check currentemergency ordersaffecting Kenai River salmon sport fisheries as regulations are often amended.  The Southcentral Sport Fishing Regulations Summarybookletalso contains maps of public fishing locations.\n\nThe Chinook salmon early-run usually peaks in early June. Popular freshwater lures include single-hook Spin-N-Glos™, Pixees™, and Vibrax™. Popular plugs for fishing from boats include Kwikfish™ and Wiggle Warts™. A single hook has only one point (with or without a barb). Whichever lure you choose, be sure it's heavy enough to reach the deeper channels, where Chinook salmon prefer to swim. The average size of a Kenai River early-run Chinook is about 30-45 pounds. Occasionally, Chinook salmon up to 75 pounds are caught. 35lb. monofilament line is the minimum line strength recommended and should be paired with a stout mid to heavy weight rod when targeting Chinook salmon on the Kenai River\n\nKenai River early-run Chinook salmon are managed under the terms of the \"Kenai River and Kasilof River Early-Run King Salmon Management Plan\" (5 AAC 57.160). The optimal escapement goal range is 3,900 – 6,600 large Chinook salmon (> 34 inches in length) as estimated at the RM 14 sonar. Other assessment tools include angler creel surveys andin-river test gillnetting.\n\nShore anglers wishing to target early-run Chinook salmon on the Kasilof River will head to the Alaska State Parks Crooked Creek State Recreation Site, off North Cohoe Loop Road. Anglers may also fish the Kasilof River from drift boats launching at the Sterling Highway Bridge with boat retrieval occurring in the lower stretches of the river that are tidally influenced. Many guide services are available for both the Kasilof and Kenai rivers. Anglers should check the ADF&G webpage foremergency ordersthat may affect both the Kasilof and Kenai rivers chinook salmon sport fishery.\n\nEarly-run Kasilof River Chinook salmon fishery peaks in early June. Beginning May 16, bait and treble/multiple hooks may be used in the Kasilof River. Before May 16, only unbaited, single hooks are allowed. Popular lures include Spin-N-Glos™, Pixees™, Vibrax™, Okie Drifters™, and yarn flies. Lures are often sweetened with a chunk of preserved salmon roe.  Average size of Kasilof River early-run Chinook salmon is about 15-25 pounds. 20-lb. monofilament line is the minimum line strength recommended when targeting Chinook salmon on the Kasilof River.\n\nSpawning season for rainbow/steelhead trout occurs in the springtime. During this time fish become vulnerable and require conservative fishing regulations so that they are protected from over exploitation. Eggs are also extremely fragile in the first few weeks, and spawning beds must be protected as much as possible. Spring is an excellent time to observe rainbow trout spawning on the Russian River and to reflect on the conservation of this natural resource. Please note the upper Kenai River, parts of the middle Kenai River, and all Kenai River tributaries are closed to all fishing May 1 through June 10 to protect spawning rainbow trout.  Please review the Southcentral Sport Fishing Regulations Summarybookletprior to fishing.\n\nThe Kasilof River presents the only flowing water opportunity for rainbow/steelhead trout fishing in May. The Kasilof River is catch-and-release only for rainbow/steelhead trout, and fish may not be removed from the water prior to release. Through May 15, only single-hook, unbaited, artificial lures are allowed. After May 15, bait and treble/multiple hooks are allowed. The steelhead run is extremely small, so expectations of fast and furious catch-and-release action are unrealistic.\n\nDolly Vardenoften begin their spring migration in May and present a good light tackle opportunity throughout both drainages in waters open to sport fishing.\n\nThe best opportunity to fish for rainbow trout in April and May is at one of the25 stocked lakesin the area, and carefully selected portions of the lower Kenai River, Kenai and Skilak lakes. The smaller lakes are usually ice-free by early May. If the ice is not completely off the lake, try casting out to the edge of the ice where fish are feeding on freshly immerged aquatic macroinvertebrates.\n\nPublications describing these lakes are availableonlineand at ADF&G offices in Anchorage, Soldotna, and Homer.

Please check the Southcentral Sport Fishing Regulations Summarybookletcarefully before heading out to fish.\n\nThe following is apartiallist of some of the more popular sport fishing destinations.\n\nThe upperKenai River(above Skilak Lake) reopens to fishing at 12:01 a.m. June 11 (except for the Russian River \"Sanctuary Area\"). Outside the fly-fishing-only areas, legal tackle is one unbaited, single hook, artificial lure or fly with the gap between point and shank being 3/8-inch or less. In the fly-fishing-only areas, the tackle must be one unweighted, single-hook, unbaited fly with gap between the point and shank of 3/8 inch or less.  The fly must weigh less than ¼ oz. Sockeye salmon and resident species fishing in the upper Kenai and Russian rivers will be progressively getting better over the month of June as early-run Russian River sockeye salmon return to their spawning grounds.\n\nTheRussian RiverSanctuary Area is not scheduled to open until July 15 but watch the ADF&G website foremergency ordersaffecting the opening date as it is possible it will open earlier.\n\nThe lower Kenai River (below Skilak Lake) opens for trout fishing 12:01 a.m. June 11. In June, the lower Kenai River is open for Chinook, sockeye, and pink salmon, as well as, Arctic char/Dolly Varden fishing. Legal fishing tackle is restricted to one unbaited, single-hook, artificial lure, any size hook. In flowing waters, beads fished ahead of flies, lures, or bare hooks must be fixed within two inches of the hook or be free sliding on the entire length of the line or leader. There are many public access points on the Kenai River. The Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summarybooklethas maps depicting these areas and is a good resource for anglers.\n\nThere are several confluence areas within the lower Kenai River that have special tackle, Chinook salmon fishing, and boating restrictions. Double checking fishing regulations in the Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summarybookletandemergency ordersis a good idea before heading out on the water.\n\nIn June, the Kasilof River is open to fishing for Chinook salmon, sockeye salmon, rainbow/steelhead trout, and Dolly Varden. However, rainbow/steelhead trout may not be retained, may not be removed from the water, and must be released immediately if caught. Bait and treble/multiple hooks are allowed in June but can change if there areemergency ordersissued. Fishing in Crooked Creek, a tributary of the Kasilof River, is closed to Chinook salmon fishing all year and will not open until August 1 for resident species and coho salmon fishing.\n\nChinook salmon fishing continues to improve, with the early-run peaking around the second or third week of June. Once thesonaris installed, estimates of large fish passage are posted on the ADF&Gfish count webpage. If you are fishing for Chinook salmon from a boat, try single-hook Kwikfish™, Mag/Wiggle Warts™, or Spin-N-Glos™. If you are fishing from shore, try Spin-N-Glos™, Pixees™, Tee-Spoons™, or L'il Corkies™. Chinook salmon tend to run in the deeper channels, down the middle of the river. Be sure you have enough weight on your line so that your lure crosses their path. Always checkregulationsandemergency ordersbefore heading out to fish. There are some closed areas of the river, special tackle restrictions, length restrictions, annual limits, and specific bag and possession limits for early-run Chinook salmon. Regulations for the early-run often change byemergency orderas well.\n\nIn the Kasilof River, early-run Chinook salmon fishing continues to build until the late-June peak. Excellent catches of 15-25 pound fish are often reported. The early-run is comprised of both hatchery- and naturally-produced Chinook salmon with varying regulations for each. Make sure to double check sport fishingregulationsandemergency ordersbefore hitting the river. Bait and treble/multiple hooks may now be used throughout the Kasilof River. Crooked Creek remains closed to Chinook salmon fishing all year and opens to fishing for other species on August 1.\n\nJune is the month that early-run sockeye salmon begin to return to the Russian River. TheRussian Riveris a tributary to the Kenai River and is located at approximately river mile 74. June 11 is opening day for fishing on the Russian River. Larger numbers of sockeye salmon aren’t usually present until the last week of June.  To access the Russian River anglers often use the Russian River Ferry system or the Chugach National Forest Russian River Campground. Day use parking and camping is available with extensive trails and boardwalks. The Russian River is a beautiful, clear water stream that is wadable. Be bear aware and adhere toU.S. Forest Service forest ordersregarding filleting fish, fish disposal, personal gear, and coolers.\n\nLegal tackle in the Russian River and Sanctuary area is one unweighted, single-hook, artificial fly, with gap between point and shank 3/8 inch or less. The fly must weigh less than ¼ oz. If weights are used, they must be at least 18 inches ahead of the fly. Most anglers use a bucktail streamer fly, such as a Russian River coho fly, with enough weight so that the fly/hook travels close to the river bottom. Oftentimes, best success is early morning or late evening, when the sun is not directly shining on the river. Sockeye also tend to hug the bank, and long casts are not necessary.\n\nThe small run of early-run Russian River sockeye does not present much of an opportunity to harvest fish in the mainstem Kenai River downstream of Skilak Lake. The biological escapement goal for Russian River early-run sockeye salmon is 22,000-42,000 sockeye salmon.\n\nWhen theRussian River weiris installed, daily counts are posted on the ADF&Gfish count webpage.\n\nResidents of Alaska may participate in a \"personal use\" dipnet and gillnet fishery that opens on June 25 at the mouth of the Kasilof Rivers. AnUpper Cook Inlet Personal Use permitand acurrent sport fishing licenseis required to participate in these fisheries. Special regulations apply. Make sure to check the Southcentral Sport Fishing Regulations Summarybookletfor information on fishing times, marker locations, fin clipping, recording harvest, and permit requirements.\n\nWhile flowing water closures to protect spawning rainbow trout are in effect, it can be a great time to concentrate on one of the many Kenai Peninsula's stocked lakes. There are25 lakesthroughout the Northern Kenai Peninsula area that are stocked with rainbow trout, Arctic char and/or landlocked Chinook or coho salmon. Fishing is usually excellent in these lakes in June. Using small spinners, flies, or, where legal, fresh shrimp or preserved salmon roe are recommended tackle. Publications describing these lakes are availableonlineand at ADF&G offices in Anchorage, Soldotna, and Homer. Make sure to check the ADF&Gfish stockingand the ADF&G Alaska Lakes Database(ALDAT)webpages for up-to-date lake stocking information.\n\nAll other Kenai River drainage lakes are open to fishing, with the exceptions of Crescent Lake which is closed to all fishing May 1 - June 10. Bait may be used in all lakes except ¼ mile of all inlet streams that flow into Kenai Lake, Kenai Lake outlet, and Kenai Lake inlet on Skilak Lake. Make sure to check the Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summarybookletcarefully!"

Bait and treble/multiple hooks can be used throughout the Kasilof River but be aware ofemergency ordersaffecting sport fisheries for salmon in the drainage. Crooked Creek remains closed to all fishing through July 31 and is closed to Chinook salmon fishing year-round.  Please respect private property.\n\nJuly is usually the month for a bounty of sockeye salmon returning to theKenai,Russian, and Kasilof rivers. In peak years, more than 40,000 sockeye salmon per day have entered the Kenai River to be caught by both boat and shore anglers. Best times are usually the third and fourth week of July.  Be aware there areseasonal bank closuresfrom July 1 to August 15 where the riverbank is closed to fishing, anglers may fish while standing in the river at least 10 feet of the shoreline.  Reference the Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summarybookletfor seasonal bank closures, public access points for boat launches, and shore fishing locations.\n\nThe second run of sockeye salmon on the Kenai River head for drainages throughout the river.  One popular destination is theRussian Rivermainstem, Russian River Sanctuary, and confluence area by the last week of July and first week of August.  Be bear aware and adhere to U.S. Forest Serviceforest ordersregarding filleting fish, fish disposal, personal gear, and coolers.\n\nLegal tackle in the Russian River area is an unweighted, single-hook, unbaited, artificial fly, with hook gap no larger than 3/8 inch or less.  If weights are used, they must be fixed at least 18 inches ahead of the fly. Most anglers use a bucktail streamer fly, such as a Russian River Coho Fly, with enough weight at least 18 inches ahead of the fly so that the hook travels close to the bottom of the river. Oftentimes, best success is early morning or late evening, when the sun is not directly shining on the river. Sockeye salmon also tend to hug the bank, and long casts are not necessary.\n\nDaily weir counts for theRussian Riverare posted onour website.\n\nResidents of Alaska may participate in a \"personal use\" dipnet fishery that opens July 10 at the mouth of the Kenai River.  A similar dipnet fishery also occurs at the mouth of the Kasilof River and opens on June 25. AUpper Cook Inlet Personal Use permitand acurrent sport fishing licenseare required to participate in these fisheries.  Special regulations apply.  Make sure to check the Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summarybookletfor information on fishing times, marker locations, fin clipping, recording harvest, and permit requirements.\n\nPink salmon fishing at Resurrection Creek in Hope begins to pick up by the third week of July.  This is a great fishery for children to participate in. Pink salmon are aggressive and will generally take any tackle easily.  Try fishing with a Russian River Coho Fly, Pixees™, small, colorful spoons or spinners.\n\nFishing success for rainbow trout andDolly Vardenin Kenai Peninsula drainages is generally good through the month of July, as rainbow trout and Dolly Varden chase spawning salmon upstream and feed on eggs. Good fly patterns to try include egg imitations and salmon flesh flies.\n\nThere are25 lakesthroughout the Northern Kenai Peninsula area that are stocked with rainbow trout, Arctic char, and landlocked Chinook or coho salmon. Fishing is usually excellent in these lakes in July. Try using small spinners, flies, or, where legal, fresh shrimp or preserved salmon roe.Publicationsdescribing these lakes are available online and at ADF&G offices in Anchorage, Soldotna, and Homer. Make sure to check the ADF&Gfish stockingand the ADF&G Alaska Lakes Database (ALDAT) webpages for up-to-date lake stocking information.\n\nAll other lakes of the Kenai River drainage are open to fishing in July, including Crescent Lake and Hidden Lake. Bait may be used in all lakes except in a few areas of Kenai Lake. Check the Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summarybookletcarefully!"

The middle of September usually sees great fishing all the way from Cunningham Park up to the Kenai Keys area. Popular shore access points include the boardwalks at the Soldotna Visitor's Center, Soldotna Creek Park, Rotary Park, Morgan's Landing, Izaak Walton State Park, and Bing's Landing. For a map and complete list of public access points, check out the Southcentral Alaska Sport Fishing Regulations Summarybooklet.\n\nIn September, bait and treble/multiple hooks can be used in Skilak Lake, and in the mainstem Kenai River from the mouth of the Kenai River at Cook Inlet, upstream to the Upper Killey River.\n\nExcellent coho salmon fishing can be found in the upperKenai River(above Skilak Lake) from Cooper Landing downstream to the Kenai Canyon from the middle of September to about the second week of October. Bait is not allowed, and anglers may only fish with one unbaited, single hook, artificial fly or lure. The gap between point and shank must be 3/8-inch or less and beads fished ahead of flies, lures, or bare hooks must be fixed within two inches of the hook or be free to slide on the entire length of the line or leader.\n\nIn theRussian Riverarea, coho salmon fishing is usually best near the end of the second week of September.Weir countsend on theRussian Riverby early September.\n\nIn the mainstem Kenai River (including Skilak Lake), once you keep your bag limit of coho salmon, you may not fish in the Kenai River below the Soldotna Bridge on that same day.

Best success comes in the early morning. Beginning September 16, bait and treble/multiple hooks are prohibited. Anglers may only use unbaited, artificial flies or lures.\n\nThe Swanson River system sees a very small run of coho salmon, usually appearing in the middle of September. Bait and multiple hooks are allowed in the drainage; however, Sucker Creek is closed to all salmon fishing.\n\nRainbow trout fishing in September on the upper Kenai River can be slow to excellent, depending on water conditions. Fall rain can cause the river to rise rapidly as well as create turbid conditions. Sometimes enticing a rainbow trout with a full stomach of salmon eggs to hit your unbaited lure is a challenge, but many sport fishing anglers find that's part of the fun. This is the time of year when you may have to try every trick in your tackle box to entice a strike.\n\nThere is a very small run of steelhead trout in the Kasilof River. Catching a steelhead trout is challenging, but if you are one of the lucky ones, please remember it is illegal to remove the fish from the water and it must be released immediately.\n\nDolly Vardenfishing in September can also be exciting, depending on water conditions. Dolly Varden are in their fall spawning colors at this time and are beautiful fish.

(Note: Neither the ADF&G Permanent ID license nor the ADF&G Disabled Veteran's license expire.)\n\nAs of this year, the age requirement forresidentlicenses has increased to 18, soresidentscurrently 16 and 17 years old no longer need a sport fishing license until they turn 18.Nonresidents16 years of age and older must purchase a sport fishing license. The price of a sport fishing license has increased to $29 for a resident annual license. Other license fees have changed as well, check out the link below for the current prices:\n\nhttp://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/home/pdfs/2016_2017_alaska_license_fees.pdf\n\nThe sport fishing regulations are good through April 15 of the new year. Look for new booklets around March or early April and be sure to check the new regulations!\n\nHalibut fishing is closed Jan. 1 through Jan. 31, and lingcod fishing is closed Jan. 1 through June 30. Closures are necessary in order to protect spawning fish. Otherwise, when weather permits, hardy anglers may find a few rockfish and smaller halibut.\n\nSalt water trolling for king salmon has become very popular. King salmon can be found in Kodiak salt waters year round, with fishing success typically increasing in April. In addition to their sport fishing license, anglers sport fishing for king salmon must purchase a current year's king salmon stamp.\n\nThe Buskin, Saltery and Miam Lake drainages all support relatively small runs of steelhead trout. This catch-and-release only fishery is open year round, with peak of the return typically occurring in late October. In fresh waters of the road system, from November 1 and April 30 only unbaited artificial lures maybe used (with the exception of all road system stocked lakes, Chiniak and Barry Lagoon).\n\nDolly Varden offers an excellent wintertime fishing opportunity. They can be found over-wintering in fresh waters including lakes or deep pools and are commonly caught on flies and pink colored rubber worms. Buskin Lake has the largest numbers of these excellent sport fish.\n\nRainbow trout are annually stocked in over 15 lakes on the Kodiak road system and winter fishing can be excellent in open water or through the ice. Some of the more accessible and better producing lakes include Horseshoe, Abercrombie, Lily Pond, Jack, Lee, Aurel and Caroline. The daily bag and possession limit is 10 rainbow trout (only 1 may be 20 inches or longer). There is not an annual limit or closed fishing season on stocked rainbow trout. Rainbow trout fishing is catch and release only in road system lakes that are not currently stocked by ADF&G. Check the current sportfishing regulations booklet for an updated list of stocked lakes.\n\nWARNING: Lake ice conditions in winter and early spring can be very deceptive. Because of Kodiak's mild climate, the lake ice can be very thin even late into winter. Be sure to check ice conditions carefully. Fishing can be excellent through the ice but also in open waters and right after ice-out.\n\nFishing for resident rainbows typically remains productive throughout the winter and early spring in areas supporting sizable populations of fish, such as the Malina, Marka and Afognak rivers. Steelhead fishing can be quite productive during late March and April on sections of the Karluk and Ayakulik rivers if conditions allow. Fishing Kodiak Island for rainbow/steelhead trout is open year round, with an annual limit of no more than 2 fish 20\"or longer. All harvested rainbow trout/steelhead 20\" or longer must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record."

    "full_text": "Halibut fishing in the Kodiak area is fair in the early part of May, but typically improves throughout the month. Chiniak Bay, Marmot Bay, and Ugak Bay are the frequently targeted areas. Halibut are usually found in deeper water during the winter months and migrate to shallower water during the spring and summer. Historically the average weight in the sport fishery has been 30-38 pounds in May, with about 10% of the fish over 80 pounds.\n\nRockfish fishing can be good throughout the month of May. The rockfish bag limit in Kodiak area waters is 5 fish per day and10 in possession, of which only 2 can be non-pelagic species and 1 can be a yellow-eye. In Chiniak and Marmot Bay waters, the rockfish bag limit is 3 per day, 6 in possession and 2 of these (4 in possession) can be non-pelagic and only one of the non-pelagic (2 in possession) can be a yelloweye. Pelagic species (i.e. black and dusky rockfish) are frequently caught and typically weigh between 3 and 4 pounds. Occasionally, the more brightly-colored yellow-eye are caught in deep water and average 9 pounds. There are no size restrictions for harvesting rockfish. Anglers targeting rockfish are encouraged to fish for black or dusky rockfish in waters less than 10 fathoms (60 feet) or use a deep water release mechanism to minimize mortality of released fish.\n\nLingcod fishing does not open until July 1.\n\nSharks are occasionally taken in the Kodiak area. The daily bag limit for sharks is one fish of any species (except spiny dogfish), with an annual limit of two sharks. The bag limit for spiny dogfish is 5 per day, 5 in possession with no annual limit. Edible species include spiny dogfish and salmon sharks. All harvested sharks (except spiny dogfish) must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record. Please do not cut off the head or tail until after the fish is landed to ensure that ADF&G port samplers have an opportunity to obtain measurements.\n\nBeginning in late May, the Division of Sport Fish annually collects data from the recreational marine waters fishery in the Kodiak area. A department technician interviews returning anglers and samples halibut, rockfish, lingcod, and sharks for length, weight, sex, and age statistics, and also records individual catches of salmon. You can help the success of this program by agreeing to be interviewed and waiting to fillet or cut up any harvested fish until they can be sampled at the harbor by department technicians. Information collected by this project is used to monitor the health of the fishery, advise halibut management agencies, and help the Board of Fisheries formulate regulations that protect fish stock and provide maximum fishing opportunity. For more information about the ground fish research program, contact Martin Schuster in the Homer ADF&G Office at (907) 235-1730.\n\nSalt water trolling for Kodiak king salmon has become very popular. King salmon can be found in salt waters year round, with typically excellent fishing success during May. The best-known fishing spots along the road system are Cape Chiniak and Buoy 4. Kodiak king salmon average 20 pounds or less but fish up to 70 pounds are occasionally taken. In addition to their sport fishing license, anglers sport fishing for king salmon must purchase a current year's king salmon stamp.\n\nSmall numbers of king salmon are beginning to return to Monashka Creek by late May. The best fishing is along the ocean beaches and in the lower reaches of the creek. Daily bag and possession limits for king salmon harvested in fresh waters is 2 fish. For king salmon less than 20 inches , the daily bag and possession limit is 10 fish. An annual limit of 5 for king salmon harvested in freshwater is also in effect. All harvested king salmon over 20 inches taken in fresh water must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record.\n\nIn late May red salmon begin to return to the Buskin River. Less than 5% of the run typically occurs in May although fish can be found in pockets along the river. The run usually peaks in mid-June, and total weir counts average around 14,000 fish.\n\nDolly Varden present an excellent, uncrowded opportunity for light tackle action. Dolly Varden usually begin their annual out-migration to saltwater in early May. Try the Buskin River or the ocean beaches at Pillar Creek and Mission Lake. Schools of Dollies can also be found at the mouths of many rivers and creeks feeding on out-migrating pink salmon fry. Anglers usually use small spinners or emergent salmon fry and alevin fly patterns.\n\nRainbow trout are also available in over 15 stocked lakes on the Kodiak Road System. Some of the more accessible and better producing lakes include Horseshoe, Abercrombie, Lily Pond, Lee, Aurel and Caroline. The daily bag and possession limit is 10 rainbow trout (only 1 may be 20 inches or longer). There is no annual limit or closed fishing season on stocked rainbow trout. Rainbow trout fishing is catch and release only in road system lakes that are not currently stocked by ADF&G. Check the current sportfishing regulations booklet for an updated list of stocked lakes.\n\nBy the end of May, king salmon returns to the Karluk and Ayakulik rivers are just beginning. The Ayakulik historicallys averages an escapement of 14,000 fish while the Karluk averages around 9,000 but in recent years these runs have been much smaller. Ayakulik now averages about 9,000 fish while Karluk averages less than 4,000 fish . Returns to both rivers typically peak around June 15. Check for emergency orders pertaining to these two stocks before fishing as restrictions have been placed on Karluk and Ayakulik Chinook in recent years.\n\nSteelhead are out-migrating to the ocean during May, but fishing for resident rainbow trout should remain productive throughout the month in areas supporting sizable populations of fish, such as the Malina, Marka, Uganik and Afognak Rivers. Fishing Kodiak Island for rainbow/steelhead trout is open year round, with an annual limit of 2 fish 20 inches or longer.

Occasionally, the more brightly-colored yellow-eye are caught in deep water and average 9 pounds. There are no size restrictions for harvesting rockfish. Anglers targeting rockfish are encouraged to fish for black or dusky rockfish in waters less than 10 fathoms (60 feet) or use a deep water release mechanism to minimize mortality of released fish.\n\nLingcod fishing opens July 1 with a bag limit of two fish daily (four in possession). All lingcod landed using a gaff must be retained. Lingcod are often caught by jigging over submerged rock piles and pinnacles.\n\nSharks are occasionally taken in the Kodiak area. The daily bag limit for sharks is one fish of any species (except spiny dogfish), with an annual limit of two sharks. The bag limit for spiny dogfish is 5 per day, 5 in possession with no annual limit. Edible species include spiny dogfish and salmon sharks. All harvested sharks must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record if an annual limit applies. Please do not cut off the head or tail until after the fish is landed to ensure that ADF&G port samplers have an opportunity to obtain measurements.\n\nThe Division of Sport Fish annually collects data from the recreational marine waters fishery in the Kodiak area. A department technician interviews returning anglers and samples halibut, rockfish, lingcod, and sharks for length, weight, sex, and age statistics, and also records individual catches of salmon. You can help the success of this program by agreeing to be interviewed and waiting to fillet or cut up any harvested fish until they can be sampled at the harbor by department technicians. Information collected by this project is used to monitor the health of the fishery, advise halibut management agencies, and help the Board of Fisheries formulate regulations that protect fish stock and provide maximum fishing opportunity. For more information about the ground fish research program, contact Martin Schuster in the Homer ADF&G Office at (907) 235-1730.\n\nSalt water trolling for Kodiak king salmon has become very popular. King salmon can be found in salt waters year round, with typically excellent fishing success during July. The best-known fishing spots along the road system are Cape Chiniak and Buoy 4. Kodiak king salmon average 20 pounds or less but fish up to 70 pounds are occasionally taken. In addition to their sport fishing license, anglers sport fishing for king salmon must purchase a current year's king salmon stamp.\n\nKing salmon can be found in excellent numbers in Monashka Creek and the Olds and American Rivers in July as well as off the beaches near the mouths of these creeks. Returns of hatchery King salmon typically peak in early to mid-July in these systems. Daily bag and possession limits for king salmon harvested in fresh waters are 2 fish. For king salmon less than 20 inches, the daily bag and possession limit is 10 fish. An annual limit of 5 for king salmon harvested in freshwater is also in effect. All harvested king salmon over 20 inches taken in fresh water must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record.\n\nBuskin River red salmon fishing is generally over for the year by the first or second week of July, however, the red salmon returns to Pasagshak and Saltery rivers typically peak around this time. Saltery has the largest red salmon return on the road system, although a four-wheel drive or an ATV is needed to access the fishery. The Saltery River return has averaged 30,000 reds over the past 10 years, while the Pasagshak run is typically much smaller.\n\nLook for pink salmon to show in the salt waters along beaches near streams by mid July.\n\nCharter boats usually start trolling for silver salmon in early to mid-July as the fish school up and begin moving near shore. Popular areas to troll for silvers close to town include Cape Chiniak and Buoy 4. Silver salmon normally don't show in freshwater until mid August.\n\nChum salmon also return to Kodiak road system streams in July. Try the lower section of the American, Olds or Saltery rivers in middle to end of the month for these large, feisty salmon.\n\nDolly Varden are available during July in many of the Road System streams, and present an excellent, uncrowded opportunity for light tackle action. Try the American, Olds, Salonie or Buskin rivers. Dolly Varden can also be caught during this time off ocean beaches, particularly near Myrtle Creek and Rosyln River. Anglers usually use emergent salmon (alevin) fly patterns and small spinners.\n\nRainbow trout are annually stocked in over 15 lakes on the Kodiak road system. Some of the more accessible and better producing lakes include Horseshoe, Abercrombie, Lily Pond, Jack, Lee, Aurel and Caroline. The daily bag and possession limit is 10 rainbow trout (only 1 may be 20 inches or longer). There is not an annual limit or closed fishing season on stocked rainbow trout. Rainbow trout fishing is catch and release only in road system lakes that are not currently stocked by ADF&G. Check the current sportfishing regulations booklet for an updated list of stocked lakes.\n\nBy early July the king salmon returns to the Karluk and Ayakulik rivers are normally over, although sport fishing for in river king salmon can be excellent during this time as the fish hold in the river awaiting spawning. The Ayakulik historicallys averages an escapement of 14,000 fish while the Karluk averages around 9,000 but in recent years these runs have been much smaller. Ayakulik averages about 9,000 fish while Karluk averages less than 4,000 fish . Returns to both rivers typically are past their peak in July. Check for emergency orders pertaining to these two stocks before fishing as restrictions have been placed on Karluk and Ayakulik Chinook in recent years. Sportfishing for kings on the Karluk and Ayakulik closes by regulation on July 25th.\n\nFishing for resident rainbows remains productive throughout the month in areas supporting sizable populations of fish, such as the Malina Marka and Afognak rivers. Fishing Kodiak Island for rainbow/steelhead trout is open year round, with an annual limit of no more than 2 fish 20\" or longer. All harvested rainbow trout/steelhead 20\" or longer must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record."

    "full_text": "Halibut fishing in the Kodiak area is normally excellent throughout August. Popular areas within Chiniak Bay to target halibut during this time include Buoy 4, Cape Chiniak and waters surrounding Long and Spruce Islands. Anglers occasionally also travel as far as Marmot and Ugak Bays for less crowded fishing. . Halibut harvested from Kodiak waters average 30-35 pounds. Mooching with herring, octopus, salmon heads and artificial jig are preferred methods.\n\nRockfish fishing can be good throughout the month of August. The rockfish bag limit in Kodiak area waters is 5 fish per day and10 in possession, of which only 2 can be non-pelagic species and 1 can be a yellow-eye. In Chiniak and Marmot Bay waters, the rockfish bag limit is 3 per day, 6 in possession and 2 of these (4 in possession) can be non-pelagic and only one of the non-pelagic (2 in possession) can be a yelloweye.

In addition to their sport fishing license, anglers sport fishing for king salmon must purchase a current year's king salmon stamp.\n\nIn early August continue to look for pink salmon in salt waters near streams as well as in fresh waters. Try nearshore fishing off Myrtle and Chiniak creeks and Rosyln River near Cape Chiniak; Sargent and Russian creeks in Women's Bay; the Buskin River; and Pillar and Monashka Creek in Monashka Bay. Peak time for fishing for these excellent sport fish is mid-August. They are dime-bright in salt water, and excellent table fare. By the end of the third week of August, the pink return normally begins to taper off.\n\nRed salmon fishing at the Saltery River can still be productive during early August, although a four-wheel drive or ATV is needed to access the fishery. The Saltery run normally continues through mid August. Returns to Saltery have annually averaged 30,000 red salmon over the past 10 years.\n\nChum salmon are also still returning to Kodiak Road System streams through early August. Try the lower sections of the Olds, American and Saltery rivers for these large, feisty salmon.\n\nBy mid August small numbers of Kodiak's large silver salmon begin to show in road system streams. Angler success is often good, especially on the Buskin, Olds, and American rivers. Excellent silver salmon action can also be found by chartering a boat to troll the near shore salt waters.\n\nMill Bay and Mission Beach are closed to snagging August 16 through September 15.\n\nKing salmon returns to the road system are typically over by early August. Fish can still be found in small numbers in the American and Olds rivers, however.\n\nDolly Varden are available in many of the Road System streams, and present an excellent, uncrowded opportunity for light tackle action.

Check the current sportfishing regulations booklet for an updated list of stocked lakes.\n\nKing salmon fishing in fresh waters is now closed for the rest of the year.\n\nAlthough pink salmon are normally not a targeted species in Kodiak's remote area, excellent fishing for pinks can be found at a number of streams. During even-numbered years, drainages on Kodiak Island's west side often produce exceptionally large adult pink returns.\n\nStrong late runs of sockeye salmon are normally present on both the Karluk and Ayakulik Rivers during the month of August.\n\nChum salmon fishing in the Remote Area is at its peak in August, with the largest return occurring on the Sturgeon River.\n\nSilver returns to Afognak and Shuyak islands are earlier than those at other Kodiak drainages. From mid to late August, silver fishing typically peaks in each of these areas.\n\nSilvers also return to numerous other drainages including the Ayakulik, Karluk, and Uganik rivers. Late August through early September is the best time to fish the Ayakulik for silvers. The Karluk River return doesn't normally peak until later in September, but small numbers of silvers usually are available by late August. On the Uganik River, the silver salmon return usually peaks in mid-September.\n\nFishing for resident rainbows should remain productive throughout the month in areas supporting sizable populations of fish, such as the Malina, Marka and Afognak rivers.

Exceptions to this are Pillar and Monashka creeks and Mill Bay and Mission Beach that have stocked silver runs and the bag limit is 2 per day year-round.\n\nSeptember on Kodiak's road system sees some of the best silver salmon fishing in Alaska. Kodiak silvers can weigh as much as 20 pounds or more! Peak road system fishing is usually around mid-September. Best waters include the Buskin, Saltery, Pasagshak, Olds, and American rivers, as well as Roslyn, and Salonie creeks and Kalsin Pond.\n\nTrolling for silver salmon typically continues with excellent success through September but tapers off toward the end of the month.\n\nRainbow trout are annually stocked in over 15 lakes on the Kodiak road system.

    "full_text": "Salt water sport fishing effort drops off by early October and typically doesn't resume for species other than king salmon until May. Kodiak's inclement fall and winter weather often keeps boats stuck in the harbors. Occasionally, anglers trolling in protected bays will encounter late-run silver salmon in October and November, as well as a few feeder king salmon.\n\nHalibut can also be caught in deeper waters this time of year but again weather can be a factor in fishing opportunity.\n\nKodiak's milder climate extends the inshore stream fisheries well into November. There are plenty of rainy, blustery days keeping salt water boats inland, but determined shore anglers will find the silver salmon, Dolly Varden, rainbow and steelhead trout fishing to be excellent.\n\nSilver salmon fishing success typically slows by late October, but a few bright fish will still be available through the first week of November. Try the Buskin, American, and Olds rivers for these late arriving fish.\n\nThe Buskin River system supports a relatively small run of steelhead trout. This catch-and-release only fishery is open year round, with peak of the return in late October. In fresh waters along the road system only unbaited artificial lures maybe used between November 1 and April 30 (with the exception of all road system stocked lakes and Barry Lagoons).\n\nDolly Varden continue to present an excellent fishing opportunity. After spawning during October, they return to lakes or deep pools to over-winter, and can be caught using nymph, scud, alevin and egg pattern flies, and also occasionally small spinners and spoons. The Buskin, American, and Olds rivers; and Salonie Creek have the largest numbers of these excellent sport fish.\n\nRainbow trout are annually stocked in over 15 lakes on the Kodiak road system and fall fishing can be excellent. Some of the more accessible and better producing lakes include Horseshoe, Abercrombie, Lily Pond, Jack, Lee, Aurel and Caroline. The daily bag and possession limit is 10 rainbow trout (only 1 may be 20 inches or longer). There is not an annual limit or closed fishing season on stocked rainbow trout. Rainbow trout fishing is catch and release only in road system lakes that are not currently stocked by ADF&G. Check the current sportfishing regulations booklet for an updated list of stocked lakes.\n\nWARNING: Lake ice conditions in late fall and winter can be very deceptive. Because of Kodiak's mild climate, the lake ice can be very thin. Always check ice thickness carefully. Trout fishing can be excellent when the lakes are ice free as well, as water temperatures cool down.\n\nSilver salmon returns to Remote Area streams are pretty much over by late October, but small numbers of fish are usually found through November in some of the later systems, particularly the Karluk River.\n\nThe big news for anglers interested in fly-out fishing in October is the runs of native steelhead trout. Peak time to fish is the end of the second week of October. Very few fish remain in late October. The Karluk, Ayakulik, Dog Salmon, and Litnik systems have the highest numbers of fish.\n\nFishing for resident rainbows should remain productive throughout the month in areas supporting sizable populations of fish, such as the Malina and Afognak rivers. Fishing Kodiak Island for rainbow/steelhead trout is open year round, with an annual limit of no more than 2, 20 inches or longer.

(Neither the ADF&G Permanent ID license nor the ADF&G Disabled Veteran's license expire.)\n\nThe sport fishing regulations are good through April 15 of the new year. Look for new booklets around March or early April.\n\nHalibut fishing is closed January 1-31. After January, anglers will likely have a hard time catching large halibut because most fish are far offshore, spawning in deep water.\n\nRockfish are occasionally caught in Lower Cook Inlet while trolling for king salmon. Rockfish may be kept year-round. The daily bag limit in Cook Inlet is five rockfish, no more than one of which may be a non-pelagic species. Check the rockfish identification pages in the regulation booklet to identify non-pelagic species.\n\nLingcod fishing is open through December 31 but closed January 1 - June 30. The limits during December are two fish over 35 inches in length per day, or in possession. During the closed season, all lingcod caught accidentally must be landed by hand or with a net (no gaffs) and carefully released.\n\nSharks are occasionally caught in Cook Inlet. The season is open year-round. The bag and possession limit is one shark of any species, except for spiny dogfish which have a bag/possession limit of five fish. There is an annual limit of two sharks of any species, except for spiny dogfish which have no annual limit. All harvested sharks must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record. The most common sharks are the spiny dogfish (also called \"sand sharks\"), salmon sharks, and sleeper sharks. Sleeper sharks are generally inedible and should be released. Salmon sharks have high urea content and should be gutted and bled upon capture to ensure that the meat is edible. Spiny dogfish are a long-lived, slow to mature species that require long recovery times when stocks are over-exploited. Large and abrupt increases in the spiny dogfish population are unlikely because of their low reproductive rate. Spiny dogfish are highly migratory.\n\nSome anglers find success trolling for \"feeder\" king salmon throughout winter. Feeder kings are fish that are feeding in Lower Cook Inlet before returning to their home stream to spawn. Plastic hootchies or tube flies in green, chartreuse, or blue herring trolled behind dodgers/flashers are often effective, as are variously-colored spoons and spinners. Dressing the tackle with herring can improve success.\n\nAlthough there is no seasonal limit at this time of year, and king salmon don't have to be recorded until April 1, all king salmon bag and possession limits still apply. A king stamp IS still required (unless you have the ADF&G Senior License or ADF&G Disabled Veterans License, or unless you are under 16 years old).\n\nGood fishing for pollock and cod can also be found throughout Kachemak Bay. Other species that may be caught include Dolly Varden, greenlings, Irish lord, flounder, sole, and skate. TIP: Fishing during slack tide or relatively small tidal exchanges requires less lead (sinkers) to get to the bottom and will allow greater time anchored, all of which spells \"easier fishing.\"\n\nStarting September 1, no bait or treble/multiple hooks are allowed in the Anchor River, Stariski Creek, Deep Creek, or Ninilchik River. Legal gear is single-hook, unbaited artificial lures/flies. A single hook has only 1 point. The ever-present Dolly Varden pretty much present the only fresh water possibility for winter fishing. Dollies will be overwintering in the deep pools or lakes along these systems. These streams are mostly frozen during this period, and have little open water. Proceed onto the ice with care because pockets of thin ice exist.\n\nThese streams close to all fishing January 1 through Memorial Day weekend (or the weekend before), to protect various populations of spawning salmon and trout. Please consult the sport fishing regulations before heading out to fish the Anchor River, Deep Creek, and the Ninilchik River.\n\nCaribou Lake is accessible by ski-equipped airplane or by snowmachine. Try fishing through the ice for Dolly Varden or kokanee. Leisure Lake also has a small population of rainbow trout. The ice conditions on either lake are not monitored by any state agency, and traveling on the ice is at your own risk.\n\nShrimp, crab- The shrimp and crab fisheries are closed year-round due to low population levels.\n\nClams- Only the hardiest clammers brave the weather, ice blocks and large breakers. You will need a lantern or strong flashlight if minus tides occur after 3 p.m. or before 10 a.m.\n\nButter and littleneck clams have different size and limit restrictions. Pictures in the sport fishing regulation book can help you learn to recognize the differences to avoid taking undersized butters. Bury your discarded clams neck up - they can't do it themselves and will die. Additionally, fill in any holes dug in search of clams for the protection of the other beach creatures in the hole and to prevent smothering animals under the beach gravel you have piled up.\n\nRazor clams: Beaches from the Kenai River to the tip of the Homer Spit is closed due to low population levels.\n\nOccasionally there are PSP advisories issued by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. Contact them at (907) 269-7629, or check out their PSP pages on the Internet.\n\nFor more information on fishing contact the Homer ADF&G Area Office at (907) 235-8191"

Dressing the tackle with herring can improve success.\n\nCertain salt waters from the Ninilchik River south to Bluff Point close to all fishing April 1 through June 30. Also, special harvest limits apply in some salt waters from Ninilchik to Bluff Point. These restrictions are in place to protect early run king salmon. Carefully check the “Cook Inlet salt water” section of the regulation book before heading out to fish.\n\nAll king salmon bag limits still apply. From April 1 through September 30, king salmon harvested need to be recorded on the back of your fishing license, and the 5 king seasonal limit applies. A king stamp IS required year-round (unless you have the ADF&G Senior License or ADF&G Disabled Veterans License, or unless you are under 16 years old).\n\nEager anglers ready for a change from ice fishing might want to try fishing off the tip of the Homer Spit in mid-April to early May for Dolly Varden. Try a small spinner, Swedish PimpleTM, or preserved salmon eggs. Snagging is not allowed at this time in Kachemak Bay.\n\nGood fishing for pollock and cod can also be found throughout Kachemak Bay. Other species that may be caught include Dolly Varden, greenling, Irish lord, flounder, sole, and skate. TIP: Fishing during slack tide or relatively small tidal exchanges require less lead (sinkers) to get to the bottom and will allow greater time anchored, all of which spells \"easier fishing.\"\n\nThe Anchor River is closed to all fishing until the weekend before Memorial Day, while Deep Creek and the Ninilchik River are closed to all fishing until Memorial Day weekend, to protect various spawning salmon and trout. Please consult the sport fishing regulations before heading out to fish the Anchor River, Deep Creek, and the Ninilchik River.\n\nCaribou Lake is 9 miles from the road system and is sometimes fished through the ice for small Dolly Varden and an occassional kokanee. Leisure Lake, across Kachemak Bay, also has a small population of rainbow trout. The ice conditions on either lake are not monitored by any state agency, and traveling on the ice is at your own risk.\n\nShrimp, crab - The shrimp and crab fisheries are closed year-round due to low population levels.\n\nClams - Only the hardiest clammers brave the weather and large breakers. You will need a lantern or strong flashlight if minus tides occur after 6 p.m. or before 7 a.m.\n\nButter and littleneck clams have different size and limit restrictions. Pictures in the sport fishing regulation book can help you learn to recognize the differences to avoid taking undersized butters. Bury your discarded clams neck up - they can't do it themselves and will die if you don't. Additionally fill in any holes dug in search of clams for the protection of the other beach creatures in the hole and to prevent smothering animals under the beach material you have piled up.\n\nA sport-fishing license is required to harvest clams, including razor clams. There are literally miles of good razor clam beaches available from north of the Anchor River to Cape Stariski. The limit is the first 60 razor clams dug.\n\nOccasionally there are PSP advisories issued by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. Contact them at (907) 269-7640, or check out their PSP pages on the Internet.\n\nFor more information on fishing contact the Homer ADF&G Area Office at (907) 235-8191."

    "full_text": "Don't forget: your fishing license expired Dec. 31! A sport fishing license makes a great gift -- lasts all year. (Neither the ADF&G Permanent ID license nor the ADF&G Disabled Veteran's license expire.)\n\nAngler success usually improves greatly in May, with larger fish showing up in catches. Typical sizes range from 10 to 150 pounds. The halibut fishery should be in full swing by the end of May.\n\nA halibut that is kept counts towards the bag and possession limit OF THE PERSON WHO HOOKS IT, not the person who reels in the fish.\n\nNick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon - King salmon begin to show by mid-May, and numbers improve through early June. Spoons and spinners enhanced with salmon roe or herring are popular. Also, try fishing with only herring or roe.\n\nHalibut Cove and Seldovia - Ready for some majestic scenery, fewer people, and an easier pace than the Homer Spit? Try one of these boat- or plane access-only stocked king fisheries. King salmon begin to show by late May, with numbers building until the peak in early June.\n\nTrolling for King Salmon - Many anglers find success trolling for king salmon during May in near shore marine waters from Anchor Point to Ninilchik. A fair number of the king salmon caught in May are the larger spawners, heading back to their home streams in Cook Inlet. Feeder kings are also caught. Feeders are kings from streams outside Cook Inlet that are feeding before their eventual return to their home stream to spawn. Plastic hootchies or tube flies in green, chartreuse, or blue herring trolled behind dodgers/flashers are often effective, as are variously-colored spoons and spinners. Dressing the tackle with herring can improve success and fishing with only herring is also successful.\n\nCertain salt waters from the Ninilchik River south to Bluff Point close to all fishing April 1 through June 30. Also, special harvest limits apply in some salt waters from Ninilchik to Bluff Point. These restrictions are in place to protect early-run king salmon. Carefully check the “Cook Inlet salt water” section of the regulation book before heading out to fish.\n\nAll king salmon bag limits apply, and a 5-king seasonal limit is in effect from April 1 through September 30. Each king salmon you keep must be recorded, either on the back of your fishing license, or on a Harvest Record Card. Check the regulation booklet to see which harvest report you are required to have. A king stamp IS required year-round (unless you have the ADF&G Senior License or ADF&G Disabled Veterans License, or unless you are under 16 years old).\n\nRockfish are occasionally caught in Lower Cook Inlet while trolling for salmon or while fishing for halibut south of Point Pogibshi. Rockfish may be kept year-round. The bag limit in Cook Inlet is five rockfish, only one of which may be non-pelagic species. Most of the colorful species, such as the yelloweye rockfish (or \"red snapper\"), are in the non-pelagic category. Check the rockfish identification pages in the regulation booklet to identify non-pelagic species. Additional protection is needed for non-pelagic rockfishes because of their extreme longevity and low productivity. Anglers are encouraged to fish with a single hook and to avoid fishing in rocky areas so as to avoid catching non-pelagic rockfish. Rockfish caught in deep water suffer injuries from decompression. Recent research by the department indicates that survival of released rockfish can be substantially improved by releasing fish at the depth of capture. For more information on the types and use of deep water release mechanisms, see the department’s web page athttp://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingSportFishingInfo.rockfishconservation.\n\nLingcod fishing is closed Janurary 1- June 30. All lingcod caught accidentally must be landed without the use of a gaff and carefully released.\n\nSharks are occasionally caught in Cook Inlet. The season is open year-round. The bag and possession limit is one shark of any species, except for spiny dogfish which have a bag/possession limit of five fish. There is an annual limit of two sharks of any species, except for spiny dogfish which have no annual limit. All harvested sharks must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record. The most common sharks are the spiny dogfish (also called \"sand sharks\"), salmon sharks, and sleeper sharks. Sleeper sharks are generally inedible and should be released. Salmon sharks have high urea content and should be gutted and bled upon capture to ensure that the meat is edible. Spiny dogfish are a long-lived, slow to mature species that require long recovery times when stocks are ove-rexploited. Large and abrupt increases in the spiny dogfish population are unlikely because of their low reproductive rate. Spiny dogfish are highly migratory.\n\nPlease do not remove the head or tail until ADF&G port samplers have had a chance to measure your fish.\n\nGood fishing for pollock and cod can also be found throughout Kachemak Bay. Other species that may be caught include Dolly Varden, greenling, Irish lord, flounder, sole, and skate. TIP: Fishing during slack tide or relatively small tidal exchanges requires less lead (sinkers) to get to the bottom and will allow greater time anchored, all of which spells \"easier fishing.\"\n\nDeep Creek, Ninilchik River, and the Anchor River are open only on the weekends and the Mondays following those weekends. Check the regulation booklet for specific dates. A weekend is 12:01 a.m. Saturday through midnight Monday.\n\nWater conditions can vary greatly in these three rivers according to snowmelt and rainy weather.\n\nBait and multiple hooks are allowed in the salmon fishery on the Anchor River, Deep Creek, and Ninilchik River. Favorite lures include PixeesTM, KrocodilesTM, Okie DriftersTM, and Spin-N-GlosTM, all sweetened with a chunk of salmon roe or herring. Many anglers also fish salmon roe alone on a hook beneath a Corkie with enough weight to ensure their bait is bumping against the bottom.\n\nSpecial restrictions apply, so please consult the sport fishing regulations before heading out to fish the Anchor River, Deep Creek, and the Ninilchik River.\n\nKing salmon return to the Anchor River, Deep Creek and Ninilchik River from approximately early May through late July with a peak in June. Stream conditions on the Ninilchik River are generally less turbid than on the Anchor River and Deep Creek in May during fishery openings.  The Ninilchik River is stocked with hatchery reared king salmon in addition to having a wild run.  Hatchery reared kings are distinguished from wild fish by their adipose fin (a fleshy fin just before the tail); wild fish have an adipose fin while hatchery fish are missing their adipose fin and have a healed scar where the fin was removed.\n\nAs a result of the Ninilchik River stocking program, a hatchery-only fishery is allowed on the Ninilchik River in July.\n\nShrimp, crab - The shrimp and crab fisheries are closed year-round due to low population levels.\n\nClams - Many recreational clammers choose Memorial Day weekend for their first trip of the season to the clamming beaches.\n\nYour fishing license is required to take hardshell clams and for harvesting razor clams.\n\nButter and littleneck clams have different size and limit restrictions. Pictures in the sport fishing regulation book can help you learn to recognize the differences to avoid taking undersized butters. Bury your discarded clams neck up - they can't do it themselves and will die otherwise.

    "full_text": "Anchor River, Deep Creek, and the Ninilchik River are usually open in June, but are weekend-only fisheries (Saturday, Sunday, and Monday). Please check the regulation booklet for specific dates.\n\nThe king salmon fishing success at Anchor River, Deep Creek, and the Ninilchik River often depends on river conditions. The last two weekend openers are usually drier, and water levels have usually gone down from their spring flood highs. In addition, the second or third weekend openings often see more fish entering the rivers, as this is typically the peak of the king salmon return. On the Anchor River, the final weekend opener is often slow fishing because fewer fish are entering the river.\n\nOverall, king salmon catches improve each weekend until mid-month, then catches decline as the month wears on. These rivers tend to produce better fishing early in the day, but fishing success is also tide dependent. Anglers report that they start to catch fish around one to two hours before high tide, until about one hour after high tide.\n\nBait and multiple hooks are legal gear in these streams, with salmon roe preferred. Many king salmon anglers will add an Okie DrifterTM, Lil CorkieTM, Spin-n-GloTM, or orange or red yarn as an extra attractor. Anglers fishing without bait seem to prefer PixeesTM, KrokodilesTM, or TeeSpoonsTM. Whatever your preferred method, give it a try and if that doesn't work look around and see what the lucky ones are using.\n\nPlease consult the sport fishing regulations prior to fishing these streams.\n\nThe June marine fishery for king salmon usually runs from poor to good, depending on the weather. Many kings are in the 15- to 25-pound range; occasionally fish weighing 40 pounds or more are reported. Spawning or mature fish represent a majority of the catch. Spawning kings tend to weigh in at 18-22 lbs., and fish smaller than that are typically \"feeders.\" Feeders are immature king salmon that will not spawn for several months or years and are feeding in near shore waters of Cook Inlet and Kachemak Bay.\n\nBy the end of the month, second-run kings start to show up in saltwater catches. The best bet when trolling for kings is fishing a herring behind a flasher in about 60 feet of water between Bluff Point and Anchor Point.\n\nThe stocked king salmon fisheries of Halibut Cove Lagoon require a boat for access. Seldovia may be reached by boat - regular air service is also available. Participating anglers are rewarded with majestic scenery, fewer anglers and a pleasant day away from the hustle and bustle. King salmon returns to these areas peak in mid-June, and the run is pretty much over by the end of June.\n\nMost of the action at Seldovia is centered near the bridge that crosses the Seldovia Slough. The harbor can also produce good catches. Trolling along the outside of the breakwater is effective for boat anglers, as is anchoring up in the slough at higher tide stages. The best chance of catching a fish here is on the ebb and flow of the tide. In Halibut Cove, most angling activity occurs from boats near the far end of the lagoon by the boat docks. Anglers also troll or cast on either end of the channel.\n\nBy late June, red (sockeye) salmon will enter the sheltered waters of China Poot Bay. These salmon are returning to an enhancement project financed by commercial fishermen. Not all are caught by their nets, though, and it’s possible for anglers to harvest some for their freezers. Higher concentrations of fish will be found near the mouth of China Poot Creek.\n\nAlso by the end of June, hatchery personnel at the small Tutka Bay lagoon usually see their first pink salmon of the year. These fish must first swim in Tutka Bay to return to the hatchery. Try cruising the shoreline in your Bayliner until you spot jumpers. Stop and cast a hot pink PixeeTM into the school and you can hardly go wrong.\n\nExcept for the Nick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon area, snagging is allowed in Kachemak Bay from June 24 through Dec. 31. Check the regulation booklet carefully. Before snagging is allowed, king salmon anglers cast out lures such as PixeesTM, Spin-N-GlosTM, or TeeSpoonsTM, sometimes adding salmon roe or fresh herring.\n\nNick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon - The king fishery begins in earnest in the first week of June. Because these fish are stocked into this saltwater lagoon, they have no freshwater stream to enter. These fish remain easily accessible and all will get caught. Many anglers, even some who have never before caught a king salmon, take their daily bag limit of two fish. Generally speaking, you can expect to catch a fish at this site just about any time of the day, but fishing is especially hot when the tide is flowing into the lagoon. Anglers have luck both inside and outside of the lagoon.\n\nPreferred bait is cut herring or salmon roe, sometimes suspended beneath a bobber if the tide is high. Anglers are reminded that this area remains closed to snagging until the Alaska Department of Fish and Game issues an Emergency Order (EO). Such an EO will be announced through the media and signs will be posted throughout the Fishing Lagoon area.\n\nHalibut- Weather always plays a big part in bringing back fresh halibut. June is usually a calm month, but keep a watchful eye on weather and water conditions. Times of slack tide, or very little tidal interchanges often make it easier to keep your bait on the bottom.\n\nHalibut fishing in lower Cook Inlet (Homer and Seldovia) is expected to remain good this year. Although abundance throughout Southcentral Alaska is currently above the historical average, reproduction is down and abundance is believed to be decreasing.\n\nHalibut fishing should pick up a little in June, with slightly larger fish compared to May. Most charters run 15-50 miles from Homer and fish in 100-300 feet of water. Charter boat anglers can expect to catch fish in the 10-60 pound range, although an occasional larger fish, up to 200 pounds, will be landed. Private anglers fishing closer to port will do well in 80-150 feet of water. Popular spots include the bluffs on the north side of the outer bay, and the Glacier Spit area. Halibut taken closer to Homer are typically smaller, in the 10-40 pound range, with occasional larger fish up to 100 pounds or more.\n\nHalibut fishing in central Cook Inlet (Anchor Point and Ninilchik) is usually good in June, with many boats reporting limit catches. June also presents the opportunity to harvest halibut while trolling for king salmon. Most boats fish 70-300 feet of water. Expect most fish to be in the 10-30 pound range. The majority of larger fish come from deeper water farther offshore.\n\nA halibut that is kept counts towards the bag and possession limit OF THE PERSON WHO HOOKS IT, not the person who reels in the fish.\n\nRockfishare occasionally caught in Lower Cook Inlet while trolling for salmon or while fishing for halibut south of Point Pogibshi. Rockfish may be kept year-round. The bag limit in Cook Inlet is five rockfish, only one of which may be non-pelagic species. Most of the colorful species, such as the yelloweye rockfish (or \"red snapper\"), are in the non-pelagic category. Check the rockfish identification pages in the regulation booklet to identify non-pelagic species. Additional protection is needed for non-pelagic rockfishes because of their extreme longevity and low productivity.

For more information on the types and use of deep water release mechanisms, see the department’s web page athttp://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingSportFishingInfo.rockfishconservation.\n\nLingcodfishing is closed until July 1 to protect male lingcod guarding their nests. Targeting lingcod, even for catch and release, is not allowed. All lingcod caught unintentionally must be landed without the use of a gaff and carefully released.\n\nSharksare occasionally caught in Cook Inlet. The season is open year-round. The bag and possession limit is one shark of any species, except for spiny dogfish which have a bag/possession limit of five fish. There is an annual limit of two sharks of any species, except for spiny dogfish which have no annual limit. All harvested sharks must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record. The most common sharks are the spiny dogfish (also called \"sand sharks\"), salmon sharks, and sleeper sharks. Sleeper sharks are generally inedible and should be released.

Large and abrupt increases in the spiny dogfish population are unlikely because of their low reproductive rate. Spiny dogfish are highly migratory.\n\nPlease do not remove the head or tail until ADF&G port samplers have had a chance to measure your fish.\n\nGood fishing for pollock and cod can also be found throughout Kachemak Bay. Other species that may be caught include Dolly Varden, greenling, Irish lord, flounder, sole, and skate. TIP: Fishing during slack tide or relatively small tidal exchanges requires less lead (sinkers) to get to the bottom and will allow greater time anchored, all of which spells \"easier fishing.\"\n\nThe Division of Sport Fish collects data on the recreational bottomfish harvest landed in Homer and on the beaches at Anchor Point and Deep Creek. Fishery technicians interview returning anglers and sample halibut, rockfish, and sharks for length, weight, sex, and age. You can help by providing information when interviewed and by allowing technicians to sample your catch. Information collected by this project is used to monitor the health of the fishery, advise halibut management agencies, and help the Alaska Board of Fisheries formulate regulations that protect fish stocks and provide maximum fishing opportunity. Contact ADF&G in Homer at (907) 235-1730 for additional information.\n\nShrimp and crab- The shrimp and crab fisheries are closed year-round, due to low population levels.\n\nClams- Lower Cook Inlet in June often sees at least one or two series of minus tides, the best times to dig for clams. Clam diggers are reminded that a sport-fishing license is needed to dig for clams. Butter and littleneck clams have different size and limit restrictions. Pictures in the sport fishing regulation book can help you learn to recognize the differences to avoid taking undersized butters. Additionally, it is a good practice to fill in any holes dug in search of clams, and to bury your discarded clams neck up.\n\nThere are literally miles of good razor clam beaches available from Bluff Point north to the mouth of the Kenai River. The limit is the first 60 razor clams dug. All razor clams dug must be kept.\n\nOccasionally there are PSP advisories issued by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. Contact them at (907) 269-7629, or check out their PSP pages on the Internet.\n\nFor more information on the Lower Kenai Peninsula salmon sport fisheries contact the Homer Area Office at (907) 235-8191."

    "full_text": "Halibut fishing in July in the Lower Cook Inlet area is usually excellent, and slows only when the weather prohibits boats from visiting all their usual spots. Fish are taken anywhere from the shallow kelp beds at 25 feet to the 400- to 500-feet deep waters of Kennedy Entrance. Sizes range from 10 to 400 pounds. The choice bait in July for halibut is red (sockeye) salmon heads, but herring follows as a close second.\n\nHalibut fishing in lower Cook Inlet (Homer and Seldovia) is expected to remain good this year. Although abundance throughout Southcentral Alaska is currently above the historical average, reproduction is down and abundance is believed to be decreasing.\n\nA halibut that is kept counts towards the bag and possession limit OF THE PERSON WHO HOOKS IT, not the person who reels in the fish.\n\nIn July, the king salmon season is over in the Anchor River, Deep Creek, and the Ninilchik River. Even though there may still be a few king salmon in the lower sections of these streams, it is illegal to fish for them. Kings inadvertently caught must be released unharmed, immediately, and without removing them from the water.\n\nIn the salt water off of Deep Creek and the Anchor River, king salmon from the second run are not usually caught until mid-July. This run is sporadic, and success is often spotty. An occasional silver salmon can also be caught trolling the marine waters of these areas during late July.\n\nRegulations allow fishing in Anchor River, Deep Creek, Ninilchik River, and Stariski Creek ONLY in the lower two miles (approximately) of each stream. The upper reaches of these streams are closed to fishing through the end of July to protect spawning king salmon.\n\nBy mid-July, pink salmon start to enter these streams. They are an excellent way to introduce a novice to fishing, and pink salmon are excellent table fare, when fresh, as well. Look for silver salmon to start moving into Lower Kenai Peninsula streams by the end of July.\n\nBait and multiple hooks are legal gear in the sections of these streams open to salmon fishing, with salmon roe preferred. Anglers fishing without bait seem to prefer PixeesTM, KrokodilesTM, or TeeSpoonsTM. Whatever your preferred method, give it a try and if that doesn't work, look around and see what the lucky ones are using.\n\nNick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon - Look for silvers to show in the Lagoon around July 15. The run will build through early August. For the best success, fish the tide as it flows into the lagoon using egg clusters or cut herring. Spoons and spinners are also producers at any tide stage. During slack water periods try fishing cut herring below a bobber.\n\nChina Poot Bay - Red salmon enter this bay, located about 4 miles east of the Homer Spit, by the first of July. Commercial fishermen finance the stocking of this enhancement fishery, so they harvest as many fish as they can, but some are missed. Snagging of red salmon is allowed in salt waters outside the ADF&G marker at the mouth of China Poot Creek. The daily bag and possession limit is 6. Alaskan residents are allowed to use dip nets to harvest up to 6 red salmon per day upstream of the ADF&G marker in China Poot Creek. Remember: dipnetting is allowed only in the fresh waters of the creek upstream of the ADF&G marker! No permit is required, but you must have an Alaska resident fishing license. The tips of the tail fins must also be removed immediately, to mark the fish as personal use.\n\nOther locations - The third week of July is the time to begin fishing near Glacier Spit, located across Kachemak Bay from Homer, at the foot of Grewingk Glacier. Locals have fished this area for pink and silver salmon and halibut for decades. Try casting a hot pink PixeeTM from the shoreline, or if you prefer, trolling in tight to the beach. More adventurous anglers can find protected moorage in a small shallow saltwater embayment located on the spit. This allows boaters to fish from the beach or even to picnic, hike, or camp overnight.\n\nRockfish are occasionally caught in Lower Cook Inlet while trolling for salmon or while fishing for halibut south of Point Pogibshi. Rockfish may be kept year-round. The bag limit in Cook Inlet is five rockfish, only one of which may be non-pelagic species. Most of the colorful species, such as the yelloweye rockfish (or \"red snapper\"), are in the non-pelagic category. Check the rockfish identification pages in the regulation booklet to identify non-pelagic species.

For more information on the types and use of deep water release mechanisms, see the department’s web page athttp://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingSportFishingInfo.rockfishconservation.\n\nLingcod fishing opens July 1 with a limit of 2 lingcod daily or in possession. All harvested lingcod must be at least 35 inches in length.\n\nSharks are occasionally caught in Cook Inlet. The season is open year-round. The bag and possession limit is one shark of any species, except for spiny dogfish which have a bag/possession limit of five fish. There is an annual limit of two sharks of any species, except for spiny dogfish which have no annual limit. All harvested sharks must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record.

Contact ADF&G in Homer at (907) 235-1730 for additional information.\n\nDolly Varden begin to show up in the Anchor River, Deep Creek, and Ninilchik River in early July, with the peak of their migration in mid- to late July. Dollies provide excellent action on light tackle. In the Anchor River, steelhead are at the end of their spawning period and the few straggling outmigrants could be hooked as they make their way back to salt waters. Spawning has greatly depleted their energy reserves. They should be landed quickly and carefully released. Doing so will greatly increase the chance that they will survive and return at a later date as larger fish to spawn.\n\nPlease consult the sport fishing regulations prior to fishing the Anchor River, Deep Creek, and Ninilchik River.\n\nShrimp and crab - The shrimp and crab fisheries are closed year-round due to low population levels.\n\nClams - Lower Cook Inlet in July often sees at least one or two series of minus tides, the best times to dig for clams. Clam diggers are reminded that a sport fishing license is needed to dig clams. Butter and littleneck clams have different size and limit restrictions. Pictures in the sport fishing regulation book can help you learn to recognize the differences to avoid taking undersized butters. Bury your discarded clams neck up - they can't do it themselves and will die. Additionally, fill in holes dug in search for the protection of the other beach creatures in the hole and to prevent smothering the ones under the pile you have dug.\n\nThere are literally miles of good razor clam beaches available from north of the Anchor River to Cape Kasilof. The limit is the first 60 razor clams dug. All razor clams dug must be kept.\n\nOccasionally there are PSP advisories issued by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.

    "full_text": "Early to mid-August sees some nice fish brought to Homer and Deep Creek, but angler success varies with the weather and the tides. Larger autumn tides make it hard to keep bait on the bottom. Most fish are between 10 and 100 pounds. Later in the month, weather often keeps boats from traveling far from port.\n\nA halibut that is kept counts towards the bag and possession limit OF THE PERSON WHO HOOKS IT, not the person who reels in the fish.Fresh Waters - Anchor River, Deep Creek, Ninilchik River\n\nBy the end of the first week of August, silver salmon start to show in good numbers in these Lower Kenai Peninsula streams. Silvers reach their peak here around August 20, and are available after that through early September.\n\nPlease be careful to keep only the silvers! Some anglers confuse steelhead trout with silver salmon. Since steelhead/ rainbow trout are catch-and-release only in these streams, it is the angler's responsibility to be able to distinguish between steelhead/rainbow trout that must be released and silver salmon that may be kept. Check the fish ID pages in the regulation booklet. If it has spots on BOTH lobes of the tail and spots above and below the lateral line (the line running from head to tail down the center of the fish’s side), it is a steelhead/rainbow trout. If it has spots only on the UPPER lobe of the tail, it is a silver salmon.\n\nUntil September 1, bait and multiple hooks are legal gear in the sections of these streams open to salmon fishing, with salmon roe the preferred bait. Anglers fishing without bait seem to prefer smaller Spin-N-GlosTM, PixeesTM, KrocodilesTM, or TeeSpoonsTM. Whatever your preferred method, give it a try and if that doesn't work, look around and see what the lucky ones are using.\n\nPink salmon will also be available in these streams until mid-August.\n\nFishing for king salmon in these streams is closed for the season.\n\nIn August, Dolly Varden are also running in the Anchor, Deep Creek, and Ninilchik rivers. Dollies provide excellent action on light tackle.\n\nPlease consult the sport fishing regulations prior to fishing.\n\nSaltwater trolling - Silver salmon are abundant in August and can be caught by trolling, weather permitting. Best results are often with downriggers, using flashers/dodgers and herring. It's still possible to pick up a late-run king salmon by trolling the salt waters from Bluff Point to the Ninilchik River in August but mostly you’ll find feeder kings (kings from streams outside of Cook Inlet that are here feeding before returning to their natal stream to spawn).\n\nNick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon - An early run of silver salmon will return from mid-July to mid-August, immediately followed by a late run of silvers. This provides almost continuous silver salmon action at the lagoon from July through mid-September. The peak of the late silver run to the lagoon is the third or fourth weeks of August. Try using salmon egg clusters or cut herring as well as spoons or spinners. Many anglers try their luck about 1-2 hours before high tide, when the water is rushing into the lagoon, through the high tide.\n\nSilver anglers also fish right off the tip of the Homer Spit, either casting spoons and spinners from shore, or trolling from a boat.\n\nChina Poot Bay - Red salmon continue to be available for snagging through the first week of August in this bay located about 4 miles east of the Homer Spit. A few pink salmon also return here, and are available in early August.\n\nOther locations - Fishing near Glacier Spit, located across Kachemak Bay from Homer, at the foot of Grewingk Glacier, is good in August for silver salmon. Try casting a hot pink PixeeTM from the shoreline, or if you prefer, troll close to the beach. You might pick up a feeder king if you troll along the shoreline here. More adventurous anglers can find protected moorage in a small shallow saltwater embayment located on the spit. This allows boaters to fish from the beach or even to picnic, hike, or camp overnight.\n\nRockfish are occasionally caught in Lower Cook Inlet while trolling for salmon or while fishing for halibut south of Point Pogibshi. Rockfish may be kept year-round. The bag limit in Cook Inlet is five rockfish, only one of which may be non-pelagic species. Most of the colorful species, such as the yelloweye rockfish (or \"red snapper\"), are in the non-pelagic category. Check the rockfish identification pages in the regulation booklet to identify non-pelagic species. Additional protection is needed for non-pelagic rockfishes because of their extreme longevity and low productivity. Anglers are encouraged to fish with a single hook and to avoid fishing in rocky areas so as to avoid catching non-pelagic rockfish. Rockfish caught in deep water suffer injuries from decompression. Recent research by the department indicates that survival of released rockfish can be substantially improved by releasing fish at the depth of capture. For more information on the types and use of deep water release mechanisms, see the department’s web page athttp://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingSportFishingInfo.rockfishconservation.\n\nAdditional protection is needed for non-pelagic rockfishes because of their extreme longevity and low productivity. Anglers are encouraged to fish with a single hook and avoid fishing in rocky areas to minimize their catch of non-pelagic rockfish. Rockfish taken from more than 10 fathoms (60 feet) of water usually do not survive release, and should be retained if possible.\n\nLingcod fishing is open July 1 through December 31. The limit in Cook Inlet waters west of Gore Point is two lingcod daily or in possession. All lingcod must be at least 35 inches long.\n\nSharks are occasionally caught in Cook Inlet. The season is open year-round. The bag and possession limit is one shark of any species, except for spiny dogfish which have a bag/possession limit of five fish. There is an annual limit of two sharks of any species, except for spiny dogfish which have no annual limit. All harvested sharks must be recorded immediately upon capture on your license or harvest record. The most common sharks are the spiny dogfish (also called \"sand sharks\"), salmon sharks, and sleeper sharks. Sleeper sharks are generally inedible and should be released. Salmon sharks have high urea content and should be gutted and bled upon capture to ensure that the meat is edible. Spiny dogfish are a long-lived, slow to mature species that require long recovery times when stocks are over-exploited. Large and abrupt increases in the spiny dogfish population are unlikely because of their low reproductive rate. Spiny dogfish are highly migratory.\n\nGood fishing for pollock and cod can also be found throughout Kachemak Bay. Other species that may be caught include Dolly Varden, greenlings, Irish lord, flounder, sole, and skate. TIP: Fishing during slack tide or relatively small tidal exchanges requires less lead (sinkers) to get to the bottom and will allow greater time anchored, all of which spells \"easier fishing.\"\n\nThe Division of Sport Fish collects data on the recreational bottomfish harvest landed in Homer and on the beaches at Anchor Point and Deep Creek. Fishery technicians interview returning anglers and sample halibut, rockfish, and sharks for length, weight, sex, and age. You can help by providing information when interviewed and by allowing technicians to sample your catch. Information collected by this project is used to monitor the health of the fishery, advise halibut management agencies, and help the Alaska Board of Fisheries formulate regulations that protect fish stocks and provide maximum fishing opportunity. Contact Barbi Failor in Homer at (907) 235-1730 for additional information.\n\nShrimp, crab - The shrimp and crab fisheries are closed year-round due to low population levels.\n\nClams - Lower Cook Inlet has low minus tides in August, but the minus tides usually arrive later in the day. By mid- to late August, you might need a lantern or strong flashlight. Minus tides are the best ones to dig for clams because more beach area is exposed.\n\nYou will also need a sport fishing license to dig clams. Butter and littleneck clams have different size and limit restrictions. Pictures in the sport fishing regulation book can help you learn to recognize the differences to avoid taking undersized butters. Bury your discarded clams neck up - they can't do it themselves and will die. Additionally, fill in any holes dug in search of clams for the protection of the other beach creatures in the hole and to prevent smothering animals under the pile you’ve dug out of the hole.\n\nThere are literally miles of good razor clam beaches available from north of the Anchor River to Cape Kasilof. The limit is the first 60 razor clams dug. All razor clams dug must be kept.\n\nOccasionally there are PSP advisories issued by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. Contact them at (907) 269-7629, or check out their PSP pages on the Internet.\n\nFor more information on fishing contact the Homer ADF&G Area Office at (907) 235-8191."

    "full_text": "It's still possible to enjoy good halibut fishing in early September, but as the month goes on, bad weather often keeps boats in the harbor, and the larger fish begin their migration off-shore. Halibut caught this time of year are typically in the 10-50 pound range.\n\nA halibut that is kept counts towards the bag and possession limit OF THE PERSON WHO HOOKS IT, not the person who reels in the fish.\n\nStarting September 1, no bait or treble/multiple hooks are allowed in these streams. Legal gear is single-hook, unbaited, artificial lures/flies. A single hook has only 1 point.\n\nAlthough past the peak, fair numbers of silver salmon will continue to enter the Anchor River, Deep Creek, Ninilchik River, and Stariski Creek until mid- to late September. Popular lures include single-hook PixeesTM, single-hook Okie DriftersTM, and any brightly-colored, flashy fly.\n\nSteelhead fishing on the Anchor River nears its peak in mid-September. Deep Creek and Ninilchik River also support a very small run of these sea-run trout. This is a catch-and-release ONLY fishery, and rainbow/steelhead trout may not be removed from the water. A good way to record your catch on film is for both the angler and the photographer to kneel in the water, with the fish held in the water.\n\nDolly Varden continue to be available through ice-up. Dollies provide excellent action on light tackle.\n\nCertain waters are open to salmon fishing, and certain waters are closed. Please consult the sport fishing regulations before heading out to fish the Anchor River, Deep Creek, and the Ninilchik River.\n\nDeep Creek trolling - If the weather is good, many anglers have fair to excellent success trolling for silver salmon between Stariski Creek and the Ninilchik River. Trolling around Bluff Point is also productive. Best results are often with downriggers, using flashers/dodgers and herring.\n\nNick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon – Although it’s the downslope of the run, silvers continue to trickle into the lagoon until mid-September. Most silvers are caught fishing either the flooding high or ebbing low tides. Silver anglers also fish from the tip of the Homer Spit, either casting spoons and spinners from shore, or trolling from a small boat. The fishing lagoon opens to snagging by emergency order in mid-September if there are enough fish left. Keep alert for new releases regarding snagging.\n\nRockfish are occasionally caught in Lower Cook Inlet while trolling for salmon or while fishing for halibut south of Point Pogibshi.

Sport fishing and rod-and-reel subsistence fishing is nearly impossible currently due to high flow and turbidity. In addition, a late-arriving spring has made the arrival of king salmon and sheefish into the rivers about two weeks later than usual.\n\n*Note:Presence of a particular fish species does not necessarily mean that it is legal to fish for that species. In addition, some waters have terminal tackle restrictions and all have bag and possession limits that may differ between drainages. Please consultcurrent sport fishing regulationsfor the waters in which you plan to fish. Sometimes sport fishing regulations are modified inseason, usually in the case of salmon. Please review any “Emergency Orders” issued in the area you are planning to fish prior to wetting your line.\n\nDuring these times of salmon conservation, it is important to use best practices when handling fish, especially if a fish is accidentally caught that is in a closed fishery. These practices include:\n\nEnjoy these western Alaska fishing opportunities, operate boats in courteous manner, pack out your waste and only leave your footprints.

Soon, egg-imitation lures and flies will become productive as salmon spawning commences. in rivers. North Slope rivers are running low and clear in most places and fishing for Arctic grayling should be good. Grayling fishing in North Slope lakes has also been productive.\n\nFishing for northern pike has been great as the water levels have dropped and fish have moved into off-channel habitats of the Pilgrim, Kuzitrin, Selawik, and Kobuk Rivers. Big spoons and soft baits work well for northern pike, as do large topwater lures and flies.\n\nFishing for Arctic char and lake trout in North Slope lakes has been good but the lake trout and Arctic char will move into deeper water as the temperatures rise during mid-day. Fishing effort for burbot has historically been low in the Northwest and the North Slope Management Areas (NW/NSMA) but large fish can be found in many North Slope rivers and lakes. These are almost exclusively caught with cut bait fished on the bottom.\n\nSheefish have begun their upstream migration to spawning grounds in the Kobuk and Selawik Rivers, and fish have been caught near the Kobuk River villages of Selawik and Kobuk. Spawning generally occurs in late-September, just before freeze-up.\n\nSpawning runs of Dolly Varden have begun upstream migration in Northwestern and North Slope rivers, and fish will trickle in through August. The Noatak and Wulik Rivers are the most popular spots for large Dolly Varden, with fish over 12 pounds possible in both drainages.\n\nPlease review theEmergency Orders and Advisory Announcementsbelow in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip:\n\nCall Northwest and North Slope Area Management Biologist Brendan Scanlon at (907) 459-7268."

Catches of king salmon in the Kanektok and Goodnews Rivers are reported to be good.\n\nThe Kuskokwim Bay rivers (Kanektok, Goodnews, Arolik) may be a good alternative to king fishing on the Kuskokwim river tributaries. The Kuskokwim Bay tributaries remain open at this time – but please check for any announcements prior to making plans.\n\nThe US Fish and Wildlife Service (Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge) has closed the harvest of king, chum and coho salmon to people that are not residents of the Kuskokwim River (but not currently the Kuskokwim Bay Rivers). Please contact their office in Bethel at(907) 543-3151for more information.\n\nSheefish are catchable at the mouths of many clearwater rivers such as the Aniak and Holitna Rivers, as well as other clearwater streams near Bethel such as the Kwethluk and Kisaralik Rivers. Large colorful spoons and spinners work well for these. Initially, high water levels have given way to more average levels and clarity which has contributed to better catchability.\n\nRainbow trout catches are currently reported as fair in both the sport fisheries and the subsistence rod-and-reel fisheries. These popular fisheries occur in the Kuskokwim Bay Rivers - Goodnews, Kanektok, and Arolik, and in the lower Kuskokwim drainages that include the Kisaralik, Kwethluk, Kasigluk, and Aniak Rivers. These are popular guided and outfitted fisheries in remote Alaska, with many private businesses that provide excellent services and opportunities.\n\nDolly Varden catches have been reported to be spotty to poor in many Kuskokwim River tributaries.\n\nNorthern pike fishing has been excellent with increasing water clarity as the high water conditions have decreased. Any clearwater mouth or connected slough complex along the mainstem Kuskokwim River affords excellent fishing. Anything that imitates prey and attracts attention will work. Crocodiles and larges spoons work anytime, and topwater lures such as jitterbugs and large fly patterns work best in late evening under the midnight sun when the large pike will lurk in the warm surface waters.\n\nPlease review theEmergency Orders and Advisory Announcementsbelow in their entirety before heading out on your next fishing trip:\n\nDuring these times of salmon conservation, it is important to use best practices when handling fish, especially if a fish is accidentally caught that is in a closed fishery. These practices include:\n\nEnjoy these western Alaska fishing opportunities, operate boats in courteous manner, pack out your waste and only leave your footprints. Good luck fishing!\n\nDon’t forget to bring your 2025 sport fishing license. You may purchase your sport fishing license online at theADF&G Online Store. Also, be sure to reviewEmergency Ordersand the2025 Northern Sport Fishing Regulations Summary Bookletfor the area you are fishing before you head out.\n\nFor more information, please call Kuskokwim-Goodnews Area Manager John Chythlook at(907) 459-7361."

Spoons, spinners, and flashy flies should work well for both chum and pink salmon.  Fishing for Dolly Varden and Arctic grayling should be good.  Try using small jigs and smolt-imitation flies. Dry flies will catch Arctic grayling as well, with the Fish/Niukluk, Snake, and Sinuk rivers being the best roadside streams to try.  Fishing for northern pike should pick up in the lower Pilgrim and Kuzitrin rivers as the water drops and warms up.  Burbot fishing is generally poor in Norton Sound streams, but there are a few to be caught in the Fish, Pilgrim, and Kuzitrin rivers with fresh bait fished on the bottom.\n\nRiver levels are dropping as snowmelt subsides, and fishing for Dolly Varden and Arctic grayling should pick up.  Fishing for Dolly Varden may be slow until mid-July, then pick up and be good through mid-September in the Noatak, Wulik, and Kivalina rivers.  Kobuk River tributaries such as the Squirrel, Salmon, and Hunt rivers should contain Dolly Varden as well. Jigging for herring in the marine waters near Kotzebue should be slowing down now that spawning is finished, but there may still be some found at the seawall in town.  No salmon or sheefish are to be found in rivers quite yet, although you might catch juvenile sheefish (12-20 inches) in the lagoon right in town.  Spoons and rubber soft lures work best, fished close to the bottom.  Northern pike in the lower Noatak, Kobuk, and Selawik rivers will hit these lures as well."

Pink salmon runs are generally very strong in even years.  Coho salmon start entering freshwater in late-July but typically don’t peak until mid-August.  Spoons, spinners, and flashy flies should work well for chum, pink, and coho salmon, with both pink and coho salmon occasionally caught on large floating flies retrieved quickly.

Pink and king salmon fishing winds down in August in Norton Sound streams, but there are still some chum salmon around.  August is coho salmon season, with good runs of these tough fighters found in freshwater rivers throughout the Sound, particularly in the Unalakleet and Fish River drainages but also Snake and Nome rivers.  All types of flashy lures work, as does cured eggs behind a Spin-N-Glo, or just under a bobber.  Coho salmon fishing is generally good throughout the month.  Fishing for Dolly Varden picks up too as more fish enter freshwater rivers to spawn.  Arctic grayling fishing can still be good and egg-imitation flies work really well now.  Dry flies will still catch Arctic grayling as well, with the Fish/Niukluk, Snake, and Sinuk rivers being the best roadside streams to try.  Fishing for northern pike should be good in the lower Pilgrim and Kuzitrin rivers as long as the water stays low and clear.

Towards the end of August, large groups of immature and non-spawning Dolly Varden (Dolly Varden only spawn every other year once they become sexually mature in Northwest Alaska) come in to these rivers to overwinter, and in the Wulik River this can number can be over 100,000 fish.  Chum salmon are still moving into the Kobuk and Noatak rivers, however many fish tend to be in spawning colors now and are less palatable than July fish.  The run will remain steady through most of August.  Fishing for sheefish is very good throughout August, with most spawning fish in the river and most fish can be found upriver near spawning areas.  Juvenile sheefish (12-20 inches) can be caught in the lagoon near Kotzebue all summer.  Spoons and soft rubber lures work best, fished close to the bottom.

King salmon begin entering the lower Kuskokwim River during mid-May. Anglers should focus their efforts at the confluences of lower and middle river tributaries as king, sockeye and chum salmon runs continue and peak in the lower river during mid-to late June. In the upper Kuskokwim River, including the Holitna River drainage and other drainages upstream, king salmon sport fishing usually starts in late June, and peaks in the second week of July.\n\nResident Species Fishing:Many of the local rivers support sheefish, Dolly Varden, burbot, rainbow trout, northern pike and Arctic grayling.  Good fishing opportunities can be expected as water levels continue to decrease. Northern pike fishing improves throughout June as they recover from the rigors of spawning. Anglers will find northern pike in shallow waters that are adjacent to cooler deeper waters. Fishing for burbot at the mouths of Kuskokwim River tributaries is a common local practice.  Setlines are allowed for burbot fishing.  Sheefish migrate up the Kuskokwim River drainage in May and June, and often can be caught with hook and line at the mouths of clear tributaries.

The Delta Clearwater River has the largest population of coho salmon in the Interior and anglers enjoy catching these late season salmon into October. Use large streamer flies and colorful spoons to catch these bright red beauties.\n\nThere is limited road accessible sport fishing fornorthern pikein the Tanana River drainage, the major northern pike fisheries (George, Volkmar and Minto Lakes) are only accessible by boat or floatplane. Northern pike are aggressive summer feeders and fishing with surface lures such as artificial frogs and/or mice is often productive. Because northern pike are fish eaters, large silver spoons and rubber fish patterns also work well. Later in the summer weedless lures are often required, and steel leaders are a must when fishing for northern pike.\n\nArctic graylingwill be distributed throughout the Tanana River tributaries in August (Chena, Salcha, Chatanika, Goodpaster, Delta Clearwater, and Richardson Clearwater rivers). If fly fishing for Arctic grayling you will want to try to “match the hatch” with dry flies, or utilize egg patterns to mimic the salmon eggs plentiful in many Interior rivers. When dry flies aren’t working so well, fishing with nymphs usually works well for fly fishers. Anglers using spinning gear will find that small spoons, spinners, and jigs also provide high catch rates. Cast into pools and slack water eddies for the best success. Fishing is often best in the late evening under the “midnight sun”.\n\nThere are over 90stocked lakesin the Tanana River drainage, ranging from large road-accessible lakes such as Quartz and Birch, to lakes with smallpublic use cabinslike Lisa Lake and Ken’s Pond, to secluded, remote fly-in or ATV-access only lakes like Dune and Forrest lakes. These lakes are all stocked with one or more fish species. The most common species israinbow trout; other species includeArctic char, Arctic grayling, andlandlocked king and silver salmon. Remote lakes provide a greater opportunity to catch large “trophy” fish, whereas roadside lakes will have high success rates, but smaller fish, making them a popular destination to take young anglers. Jigging small shrimp, salmon eggs, meal worms, and Power bait can often produce high catch rates on stocked lakes. Fishing a baited hook under a bobber, with the bait just off the bottom will usually catch a fish. Small jigs and silver spinners will often work as well. Enticing a fish to a dry fly is always exciting and a thrill when they hit.\n\nIf practicing catch-and-release, utilize techniques that will enable you to release the fish quickly and will increase the fish’s chances of survival:"
